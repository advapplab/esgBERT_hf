              "['By the time President Joe Biden articulated it officially Thursday on Earth Day, the new U.S. pledge to halve emissions over the next nine years was one of the worst-kept secrets in climate action circles. Neither was it surprising that the U.S. president closely linked America¡¦s new nationally determined contribution, a reduction target of 50 to 52 percent from a 2005 baseline aligned with the terms of the Paris Agreement, with equitable job creation and the opportunity to make money. \"The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that¡¦s coming,\" Biden said in his opening remarks during the virtual two-day climate summit. Attended by more than 40 world leaders, the event last week included both close allies and representatives of countries whose cooperation will be critical to keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, including Brazil\\'s president, Jair Bolsonaro; China¡¦s president, Xi Jinping; India¡¦s prime minister, Narendra Modi; and Russia\\'s president, Vladimir Putin. But the Biden administration¡¦s high-level mantra that the clean energy transition is linked to an unprecedented economic opportunity was also well punctuated with virtual visits from a wide range of individuals representing the private sector. Among them: billionaire philanthropist and venture capitalist Bill Gates; new Citi CEO Jane Fraser; Oliver Bate, CEO of insurance giant Allianz; and Marcie Frost, CEO of CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund. \"Some think that confronting climate change and creating jobs and economic inclusion are in conflict,\" Fraser noted in her remarks. \"But we believe we will only be successful in tackling our global challenges if these agendas are working together. Solving climate change must be a driver and economic prosperity.\" In remarks on the second day of the summit, Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm assigned a number to that opportunity, estimating that the clean energy transition will generate 23 trillion by 2030. The \"moonshot\" potential related to hydrogen, carbon capture solutions, energy storage and addressing industrial emissions have the administration¡¦s particular attention. \"We need a mindset that overcomes resistance to change,\" she said. Environmental justice concerns were centered intentionally during the proceedings, with organizations including Grid Alternatives and Navajo Power in the spotlight. Some of the most powerful comments came from entrepreneur Nthabiseng Mosia, co-founder of West African energy company Easy Solar. \"Progress does not have to be recklessly unjust,\" she said, urging world leaders to challenge the status quo. What will get us moving in the right direction when it comes to accelerating innovation? Amid the countless announcements timed to Earth Day last week were introductions, declarations or reboots of programs aimed at accelerating breakthrough technologies and climate solutions. Here¡¦s the entire list of what the White House is proposing, and here are 10 developments from the past week not just from the Biden bunch worth particular attention: The money people are synthesizing their net-zero financing plans. More than 40 banks representing trillions of dollars in declared financing for clean energy, sustainable development initiatives, climate solutions (and more) including BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Citi, HSBC and Morgan Stanley are part of the new Net-Zero Banking Alliance. That means they¡¦ve committed to setting science-based targets for all those net-zero financing declarations that have been made over the past year and to disclosing progress regularly. Climate is front-of-mind for U.S. finance agencies. The U.S. International Development Finance Corp. committed to making one-third of all new investments \"have a climate nexus\" by fiscal year 2023. And the Millennium Challenge Corp. will put at least 50 percent of its program funding toward climate-related investments over the next five years. There¡¦s a new economic measure that values nature. The U.N. has officially approved the concept of \"Gross Ecosystem Product,\" which quantifies how nature contributes to economic activity or human wellbeing. It¡¦s a way of helping calculate the potential benefits associated with ecosystem restoration. GEP is part of the U.N. System of Environmental-Economic Accounting. Introducing the Net-Zero Producers Forum. The new group includes countries that represent 40 percent of global oil and gas production, among them the U.S., Canada, Norway, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The aim is to advance methane abatement solutions, circular carbon approaches and development of carbon capture and storage technologies.Now we know more about Alphabet¡¦s latest moonshot. The so-called Global Power System Transformation (G-PST) Consortium, which the U.S. just joined, is focused on improving grid reliability, resilience and security. Audrey Zibelman, who is leading a new X moonshot on grid reliability at Alphabet, had a hand in its creation. Bill Gates talked up a reboot of Mission Innovation. The Obama-era program got a shout-out from the billionaire breakthrough proponent, and for good reason. It has been \"reinvigorated\" with a quadrupling of funding related to clean energy over the next four years including generation advances, as well as those centered on carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen technologies. 1 billion this year in forest restoration financing. Trees are a favorite climate solution, for very practical reasons. The U.S. is allying with the U.K. and Norway to create the LEAF Coalition, a.k.a. Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance. There are already close to a dozen corporate participants including Airbnb, Amazon, Bayer, Boston Consulting Group, GlaxoSmithKline, McKinsey & Co., Nestle, Salesforce and Unilever. The U.S. is on board with shipping industry reductions (and aviation, too). The nation is officially joining work by the International Maritime Organization aimed at achieving net-zero emissions from international shipping by 2050. It¡¦s also committing to advance next-generation sustainable aviation fuels and other climate tech. One beneficiary: Ascent the Aviation Sustainability Center, which includes 16 well-respected research universities and 60 private-sector stakeholders such as Boeing, Airbus and major international airlines. Agriculture isn¡¦t being left out. The U.S. and the United Arab Emirates are co-leading the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, which will focus on national-level research and development, and support for applied innovation in the private sector. More details will be forthcoming at the U.N. Food Summit in September.  Neither is nuclear. Building on a Trump-era program, the Biden State Department announced the Foundational Inrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST), for supporting advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Given that nuclear generation is still the second-largest source of low-carbon power after hydro, it¡¦s an area that will continue to receive attention. The Biden White House isn¡¦t just hedging its bets by going broad: The world needs wholesale innovation across every sector to get closer to keeping temperature increases to 1.5 C.',\n",
              " \"A little over two years ago, Maria Pope took the helm of Oregon utility Portland General Electric, which provides electricity services to close to 900,000 customers across the state. The utility has emerged as a leader when it comes to helping Oregonians ¡X residents, businesses, public transit, fleet providers ¡X to adopt electric vehicles, and earlier this month at the Bloomberg Mobility Summit in San Francisco, Pope took the stage to talk about the utility's efforts to accelerate the electrification of transportation.?After Pope's onstage conversation, GreenBiz sat down with her to chat about all things electric transportation and what things a utility can do to do usher in the new EV era. This conversation was lightly edited for clarity and length:Katie Fehrenbacher: You said on stage that you believe EVs will be a net benefit to the grid. How is Portland General Electric (PGE) creating the ecosystem where EVs will be a net benefit to the electrical grid?Maria Pope: First of all, I think it¡¦s really important to put into context where we¡¦re going as a utility in terms of addressing climate change. As we add increasing amounts of renewables on the system ¡X today we¡¦re at 40 percent renewable and in just a few years we¡¦ll be 50 percent and we¡¦re not stopping there ¡X as we add solar power, wind power, other natural resources ... what we need most of is new renewables to come from the wind sector. The wind tends to blow at night a little bit more than it blows during the day. And as a result, if we can take that incremental wind and charge vehicles during the night, it¡¦s a win-win for everyone; it keeps the grid more stable.The other thing we¡¦ve seen west-wide, we¡¦ve all heard about the duck curve. In the middle of the day, we¡¦re generating excess power in California, which is going to Oregon, lowering our prices in the middle of the day, allowing for people who want to charge in that middle of the day ... As you know, energy has to be equal from generation to use on an instantaneous basis. So being able to store and choose when we charge is really important.Skipping forward into the future, I can see a world where we¡¦ll actually be using that same battery that might be in a bus or in a car back to the grid to provide stability. That¡¦s not yet something that we¡¦re implementing, but certainly as we put in infrastructure, we¡¦re going to be creating infrastructure that will be bidirectional to allow for the bidirectional flow of electrons.\\nFehrenbacher: Are these technology solutions? Education solutions? How do you create a system for EVs to be a benefit?Pope: So I think it¡¦s an all-of-the-above. As we look at the four major areas that are a challenge for the transformation of the transportation sector, we¡¦re looking at price, we¡¦re looking at the product and the availability of buses or cars that are electric, we¡¦re looking at customer awareness and we¡¦re also looking at infrastructure. We¡¦re addressing all of these things in connection with our partners, whether it be Daimler Trucks or whether it be our transit authority, TriMet, or whether it be Lyft or whether it be individual customers or dealerships. So we¡¦re really looking at a holistic approach.A couple of examples would be a terrific educational program that we just launched with Portland public schools around climate change, with fifth-grade climate activists at one of our local schools who are creating, along with the entire school system, an open-source educational platform that they will be able to use.Fehrenbacher: Eventually when more complicated technologies like vehicle-to-grid become more commercial, what does PGE want to do?Pope: We see this as a continuum. So right now we¡¦re implementing some of the basics around increasing our amount of renewable energy, building out our smart grid with communications networks, with the interoperability, and the vehicle-to-grid will just be an extension of what we¡¦re doing and the groundwork that we¡¦re laying. The nice thing about all of this infrastructure is that it also enhances our reliability and resiliency, whether that be in periods of wildfire or earthquakes, or other natural disasters. All of this works together to create a safe, more reliable and more affordable energy infrastructure.\\nFehrenbacher: You mentioned a partnership with Lyft. Do you think the ride-hailing companies need to be more aggressive around electrification? If so, how do you push these companies toward that goal?Pope: We think everyone should be more aggressive around electrification. We believe that we are a leader but also a convener for a clean energy future. This will take everyone to come together and change how we do things and to look at doing things differently.Fehrenbacher: For ride hailing specifically, has PGE worked with those companies to try to move the needle on electrification?Pope: We have a similar program with Lyft and a great partnership. If you¡¦re in Portland and in Oregon, you can elect to use an all-electric green vehicle on your Lyft app and that vehicle was undoubtedly charged at one of our charging stations, and we¡¦ve made it really easy for them to deal with billing and payment information and made it a seamless, frictionless process for our customers. Lyft has been a great partner in helping us figure out what works for them and what works for us as we bring this together.Fehrenbacher: Also onstage you mentioned working with newer players such as Amazon, which is deploying 100,000 EVs eventually. How does PGE or a utility in general work with such a big company on such a new and evolving initiative?Pope: I think we work with them at two levels. We work with their corporate leadership to really understand directionally where they¡¦re going and to understand the perspectives that each of us bring. Then locally we work with each one of their fulfillment centers and local management to make sure that we have the energy infrastructure that they need when they want it and how they want it in terms of deploying their electric vehicles.\\nFehrenbacher: You also talked onstage about PGE¡¦s own electric fleet. Can you discuss those vehicles a bit?Pope: Many of our single passenger vehicles are electric already, and what we¡¦ve really looked at is how do we get deeper penetration into our work vehicles? So our trucks, all the way through, to make sure that we¡¦re not just talking about electrification but really setting an example. And it¡¦s very helpful for us as we look at our own fleet and we understand charging and how we need to move forward to be able to partner with others so when we¡¦re talking to Daimler that makes electric vehicles in Oregon, we¡¦re able to understand the ecosystem in a 360-degree fashion as a user, but also as a supplier. So it¡¦s really an exciting future as we move forward.Fehrenbacher: What else should I know about what PGE is doing around e-mobility?Pope: I think the most important thing to know is that we are leading. That we¡¦re partnering. And that our customers want to be leaders and they want us to be electric suppliers and infrastructure enablers. And it¡¦s really exciting to have the opportunities that we have at the time that we have. There¡¦s no question in my mind that we¡¦re at a pivotal point and that we will begin to see the electrification of the transportation sector scale probably even more rapidly than we can envision.??Fehrenbacher: When you joined the company did you imagine that transportation would come under your purview?Pope: No, I knew that whatever we would be doing that energy is critical to the customers that we serve, to their lives, to the businesses, to the safety and health of our communities. And I knew that providing a critical product and service within the state of Oregon was really something that was important to be able to do and do well?however we¡¦re needed as we lead this transformation.Fehrenbacher: On the commercial fleet front, do you work with companies trying to electrify their buses or commuter vans, etc?Pope: We¡¦re working with a number of groups. I mentioned Amazon, but we also have UPS and Sysco, the food delivery service. We have a number of businesses, large and small, in our service territory that wants to rely on us, not just for the electricity and for the infrastructure but also for the know-how, which is one of the reasons it is so important for us to transition our fleets so that we can be partners as we move forward and share experiences.\",\n",
              " 'In the rapidly changing world of transportation ¡X as vehicles get batteries and?start driving themselves ¡X not many think about the?humble tire. But the tire industry is navigating?the same types of technologies?and innovations that its partners ¡X?the automakers ¡X?are as transportation moves to?electric, autonomous and connected.?The leader responsible for how tire giant Goodyear navigates those technologies is its chief technology officer, Chris Helsel, who\\'s been at the company for 24 years and oversees the company\\'s tire tech.?He also oversees what he calls?\"beyond tires,\" or putting intelligence ¡X sensors, data tools and?artificial intelligence?¡X into Goodyear\\'s tire services.Earlier this month, GreenBiz sat down with Helsel to chat about everything from Goodyear\\'s role in the electric vehicle?transition, to circular economy innovations, to how he thinks COVID has affected transportation sustainability goals. The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.?Katie Fehrenbacher:?What are the most important ways that technology and innovation are driving the tire business at Goodyear?Chris Helsel: First, in most every tire, there¡¦s what you might call the trade-off triangle. The No. 1 thing is how much technology goes into resolving that.?It comes down to how well you can provide good long-lasting tread wear, because you want the tire to last a very long time to give people a good value and at the same time that¡¦s also good for the environment. The longer that a tire can stay in service and perform well, the less of those tires need to be repurposed at the end of life.The second thing is the fuel economy and that is done through the rolling resistance. Basically, every time tires roll, energy is lost as they get loaded and unloaded as they go through that footprint.The third is the trade-off of traction. Making sure that under snow, ice, wet or?dry conditions, you maintain and can transmit those forces to make sure that the vehicle can operate safely.So t¡¦s how you play those three trade-offs: tread wear; fuel economy; and traction. It\\'s really not top of mind for people, but that\\'s the real technical challenge for how you deliver a premium type tire for a consumer.Fehrenbacher: In terms of fuel economy, which can save consumers and businesses on fuel costs, how important are these innovations? Do you have data points around fuel savings for customers?Helsel: I would say, No. 1, if you think about it, what the rolling resistance translates to is reduced greenhouse gas and improved fuel efficiency. There are about 260 million vehicles on American roads, and a better rolling resistance, let¡¦s say of the order of 10 percent, could mean above a billion fewer gallons of gas consumed annually. It¡¦s a big number if you think about it and the impact it can have, and it¡¦s because of that leveraging of a significant number of vehicles. So that¡¦s through the design of the rolling resistance.The second thing that¡¦s maybe not quite as intuitive is the amount of fuel, and it¡¦s about an equal amount, that can be saved by having the right inflation in your tires. Actually, it¡¦s very difficult to overcome with design what¡¦s lost simply by not keeping your tires inflated. If you kept your tires inflated, it¡¦s been estimated that if everyone was at their recommended inflation, that would save about 1.5 billion gallons per year, or 4 million gallons a day. So it would have a very big impact.Fehrenbacher: Can you tell me more about Goodyear¡¦s fleet services?Helsel: With respect to fleets, I¡¦ll just use the North America example. We have a footprint of thousands of locations where there is a drive up and on-road service for fleets.But what¡¦s more ideal is if we can prevent an on-road event. And one of the ways in which we can help provide less on-road events is by helping them keep air in their tires. If they have an injury to their tire, let\\'s say it\\'s a slow leak, we can monitor those tires with intelligent sensors, remotely pull the data, run algorithms on it, use historical data and we can push them an alert, whether directly to the driver or to the fleet manager. An alert could say, \"Hey, next time you make a stop, please stop at location X and go get some service done on that tire.\"In that way, we help drive, through those intelligent solutions, better maintenance of tires, keeping the air in them and providing better long-lasting tread wear and better fuel economy. It also adds to safety, because of less on-road breakdowns and less service needs.Fehrenbacher: Does that use AI and real-time monitoring?Helsel: Correct, it¡¦s real-time monitoring of the vehicle. It¡¦s done through an actual sensor that is put on the wheel or on the backside of the tire. What we¡¦re pulling is temperature, pressure and other accelerations. From that, it¡¦s put up into the cloud and we run those algorithms, which are a form of artificial intelligence. Those algorithms have in them those inputs as well as some key information about the tire itself. And because we¡¦re doing those across many vehicles, it has the intelligence of making a recommendation.Fehrenbacher: In terms of end-of-life management and circular systems, how is Goodyear navigating that?Helsel: I think globally, 80 to 90 percent of tires at end of life are repurposed. Now the typical repurposing of tires is into energy, like energy being used in cement kilns or being repurposed into a downstream product like materials used in asphalt or rubber blocks for parked vehicles. But the main thing to think about with respect to tires is No. 1, 80/90 percent are being repurposed.However, I think the opportunity now is how do we make that repurposing into more of the same like applications or maybe even if you could imagine upstream. That\\'s what we¡¦re doing as an industry ¡X?really investigating things like how can we use a reclaimed tire for raw materials, for example reclaiming some of the oils or reclaiming some of the carbon black that was in the tire.This is quite an interesting area for a lot of startups, so we work a lot with startups trying to develop and repurpose some of those recovered rubbers and raw materials. The most I see in our products is where we can reuse some of the ground tires in some of our retread products.It¡¦s still a bit of a challenge to recover the polymers and reuse it as a polymer. They tend to get reused as a stiffener in the rubber and because of that, you can¡¦t quite use it 100 percent and you need to use it in small parts and that gets into the details of the development period.Fehrenbacher: In terms of startups, does Goodyear have a formal startup program or is it more organic?Helsel: We actually announced at CES at the beginning of 2020 a corporate venture fund, and we actually have that as one of our tools in which we partner with startups. The idea is that as a corporate partner we¡¦re not looking to be lead investors, but as someone who can help them take their ideas forward and try their ideas and if they¡¦re hitting then bring them to scale quickly. We can take a small position to help fund those activities for startups and knowing they¡¦re awful tight on their resources.The second thing we do is to partner with universities, and we do that for two reasons. One is to get these types of technologies, and two is to get the flow of the people who ultimately might have worked on such a project. They might come in and become part of our associates.And third, there are standalone startups, just like any other supplier, they would be bringing in materials for us to evaluate. We¡¦re helping them understand some of the features of those materials that need improvement and then figuring out where they could be applied in our different tires.Fehrenbacher: Goodyear has been working on replacing petroleum oil with soybean oils. Can you talk more about that program?Helsel: That¡¦s been a real nice innovation for us and a nice collaboration outside of our normal tire industry. We started with the soybean board a few years back with the idea that we could evaluate soybean oil and how it could be used instead of petroleum. Since then, we¡¦ve been putting it into high-volume tires and lines. In 2019, we nearly doubled the amount of soybean oil that we¡¦re using now in place of petroleum. It¡¦s a win-win.If you think across your stakeholders, you want a certain performance, and you want a return to your shareholders. But there\\'s also the environment and our own associates that feel good about these products. The real win on the soybean oil is it¡¦s a byproduct of the processing of the bean. What we find is it gives a pliability to the rubber at low temperatures, which gives a better grip. So it makes for more safety and more traction in snow and ice.It¡¦s a win-win. But of course, we¡¦re also replacing petroleum.Fehrenbacher: What¡¦s Goodyear¡¦s role in the zero-emission vehicle transition of your customers?Helsel:?No. 1 is the rolling resistance, and that¡¦s been pulled by CAFE requirements in the past. But now for our new OE original equipment fitments, we see that the EV is taking a huge chunk of that work.You need tires that perform on those vehicles. What we find is that with EVs, they have a new challenge. The trade-off on an electric vehicle is, of course the range, which ties directly into the rolling resistance, just like it\\'s tied into fuel economy.Secondly is the tread wear but also the durability because the electric vehicles tend to be heavier and the heavier those vehicles are, the more loading and taxing they put on the tire. That makes the tread wear all that more difficult to maintain along with that rolling resistance and delivering something that¡¦s both long-lasting, durable and has fuel economy. And the last thing is that traction requirement especially gets difficult because of the high torque that these vehicles are capable of.So what we do to enable the adoption of EVs is come up with products that can deliver an even higher level of standards in those areas. Because if people are dissatisfied with the performance of the vehicle, that probably taxes or slows down EV adoption. People may not think about it, but because the tire is the connection to the road, it dictates a lot around the performance, feel and how people enjoy the drive. So we really have a role here and that is a role to deliver that same seamless performance in an EV as one running on an internal combustion engine.The last thing is there are challenges because there is no engine noise, and the tires need to be all the more quiet. You don¡¦t want to be sitting in your vehicle and listening to the roar of the road through the tires.Also things like aerodynamics, because you¡¦re really trying to optimize the range of these vehicles, so you get beyond the normal rolling resistance and get into aerodynamics. Additionally, even potentially the mass of the tire, that rotating inertia.So you really have to raise your game in the different ways in which you can impact that range.Fehrenbacher: How has COVID and the recession impacted sustainability goals?Helsel: When this all started, you started saying, \"Geez, how is the industry going to react?\" And by industry, I would refer mainly to our OEM customers. There was a point of view that these companies are already being put under pressure through regulation to move to EVs. That was the trajectory we were on before COVID. They had to manage these two realities: They¡¦re continuing to produce their ICE vehicles, many of their really profitable platforms there, and they are preparing themselves for the EV environment. There was one viewpoint that could see the extension of the ICE.What you really saw was a bit of the opposite. What happened is companies developing vehicles had to make a choice even sooner, to say I can only fund one of these efforts. You¡¦ve seen some announce that they¡¦re not doing any more R&D on the ICE platform.I think that trend has born out in our fitments, where you¡¦re seeing more and more EVs. I think if anything, it may have accelerated some of that transition for the auto manufacturers and their supply base.The second part for us is how we participate in that and how we bring in new material solutions. It¡¦s caused us to look beyond our normal supply base. When you go beyond your normal supply base, you start interacting with a lot of these companies that are working on new materials and also sustainable materials. I think it¡¦s led to an acceleration of us getting involved with those new materials at a higher rate than we would have previously. I think it¡¦s gotten even more attention and more opportunities to do that pulled by the focus on EVs.Fehrenbacher: Is there anything else you want to highlight about Goodyear\\'s sustainability and technology?Helsel: I think the connected piece. We talked a little bit about how intelligence can help you with inflation monitoring. I think that\\'s an area that I would highlight. That\\'s just one application and the first release of that tech. There¡¦s a whole trajectory you can lay out to monitor the inflation. By knowing the inflation of the tire and integrating that with the rest of the vehicle system, you can also contribute to safety.For example, when tires wear, those critical features get worn away and you¡¦ll see a loss of stopping distance. But by knowing that and putting it back through the anti-lock braking system or braking system, you can shorten that loss or stopping distance by over 30 percent. There¡¦s a whole lot of additional things beyond maintaining inflation we can do with mobility and connectedness.',\n",
              " \"As sales of?electric vehicles boom in certain regions of the world, the companies that provide?the necessary?battery?materials are getting ready for the ride. But, naturally, it will have to be a sustainable journey.American chemical giant Albemarle, one of the world's largest producers of lithium for EVs, recently signed on to the United Nations Global Compact and announced emissions-reduction goals for 2030 and 2050. By 2030, Albemarle plans to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in parts of its chemicals business, and meanwhile grow its lithium capacity in a greenhouse gas intensity-neutral manner. By 2050, the company plans to be net-zero carbon emissions.It'll be a huge challenge for a company that operates mines and manufacturing plants around the world that use a whole lot of energy, water and raw materials. But the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm sees more sustainable operations as a necessary part of its business, particularly when it comes to working with customers that are selling into the EV battery supply chain.?GreenBiz sat down with Albemarle CEO Kent Masters to discuss the company's recent sustainability report, its high-reaching net-zero carbon goal and how the company plans to get there. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.Katie Fehrenbacher: The company just signed on to the United Nations Global Compact. Why does Albemarle want to go in that direction?Kent Masters: A lot of our stakeholders are very interested from a sustainability standpoint. Our investor base is very interested. Internally our employees are interested in it. But also our customers. So really across all of our businesses. But it¡¦s really important for our lithium business with respect to electric vehicles.?So our customers, the OEMs and anyone making electric vehicles are very keen to understand the sustainability profile of their supplier. And we use sustainability as part of our value proposition to our customers.Fehrenbacher: The sustainability report is broken down between the three markets: lithium, catalysts and bromine. Catalysts and bromine had overall reduction targets, and then lithium was based on a target around carbon intensity over time. Can you talk a little bit about the reasons for setting these different targets, across the different business lines?Masters: For the lithium business, we're growing at, call it, a 20 percent compound growth rate basis. So there's just no way we can have an absolute reduction in those emissions by growing 20 percent a year. In five years, we're going to be more than double. So we did that on an intensity basis. To reduce the intensity of emissions per ton or kilogram of lithium, it's kind of the only way we could get to some meaningful targets.Then given the fact that we're enabling a greener economy, the use of our products reduces emissions in the electric vehicle market, we've been kind of playing off that. So we feel like it's better that we grow that business and then reduce the intensity as much as possible.Fehrenbacher:?From a financial perspective, is there an economic benefit to reducing the carbon intensity for the lithium business?Masters:?Yeah, there will be projects that we can invest in that will have positive financial returns and have a side benefit of less emissions. And those are the easier ones. Those are the ones we've either been doing or we got on our list to be doing.?It's not an easy question to answer because I think our customers are going to require us to do this. So for us to stay in business and to serve those customers, or maybe in the case of lithium to grow with those customers, we're going to have to make these investments. So it kind of gets built into the business case.?Fehrenbacher:?When you're talking about working with customers, and sustainability being attractive, what are your customers asking for? What does that mean to them?Masters: It depends on the customer base. The one where we get all the press is the electric vehicle market. The OEMs in that space that are either making electric vehicles or launching electric vehicles are all interested in sustainability. That's a key part of their offering to their customer ¡X a cleaner environment and a cleaner world ¡X and they want to make sure that their supply chain subscribes to that as well. Everything that goes into that is done either on a carbon-neutral or carbon-reduction basis, so that they are playing their part, not just in selling the cars, but making sure their supply chain is as sustainable as possible.Fehrenbacher:?What's Albemarle's role in circular batteries and making batteries recyclable? Not being a battery maker, but being a supplier in the supply chain, how can the company play a role?Masters: We see a role for us in the reprocessing of lithium coming out of that recycling circle, down the road, when that starts happening. We're not looking to be the people to take control of the batteries and break them up and get the components out. But they'll be a piece coming out of that recycling process that's going to be a lithium-containing material. And the processes to clean that up are not a lot different (from) what we use and making virgin material today from the resources that we have.So we think that there's a role for us in working with a couple of different potential partners and trying to work out what that business model might look like. But really, it would be in reprocessing lithium back to its original state. And the reason we think it's a fit for us is that the chemistry to reprocess it is very similar to the process chemistry we use today to get from raw material to a finished product.Fehrenbacher: What's the role of technology in trying to make the company more sustainable? How is Albemarle looking to connect with startups and new tech companies that can help make the company more sustainable?Masters:?We spend a lot of effort and time on our own technology focused around the lithium chemistry, and the chemistry that goes into making batteries. And maybe some of the process chemistry about recycling it. We focus there.But we also spend a lot of time making sure we understand what technologies are out there, or what startups are coming. We've invested in some small companies that have interesting technology that we think fits into our strategy. We spent a lot of time monitoring that and staying connected in the industry.If there's a technology that we think influences our key value chains, we'll either partner with them or invest in them, or at least stay knowledgeable. So we have access to that technology.Fehrenbacher:?The Biden administration is really eager to expand domestic production of minerals for batteries. Do you see these efforts as particularly exciting?Masters:?It's a little bit of a wait and see what happens. We produce lithium in Nevada. We have a mine here in North Carolina, and we can potentially reopen that. Support from the government would help us do that. It's a good resource, the quality of it is good. The questions are about what's it going to take around permitting to operate a mine in the U.S. Those are some things that we would like to engage with the administration around to see if that's possible for us to do that.We have resources around the world and ultimately they will move battery production to the U.S., and we'll be selling into that. We have strategies to localize the supply to the extent possible. That will most likely be a combination of some local minerals, and some from outside the U.S. And then in time, you would layer in a recycling stream as part of that. So it's probably going to be partially recycled, partially local and part of it from outside the U.S. to satisfy the demand.Fehrenbacher: Albemarle has three main sustainability goals for 2021: to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and get to net-zero operations; to grow the lithium capacity in a greenhouse gas intensity neutral manner; and then to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in bromine and catalysts. When you look at those three overarching goals, what do you see as being the most challenging area?Masters: Well, they're all a challenge. For catalyst and bromine, we're going to reduce the overall emissions that we have off of businesses that are growing less than 10 percent. And that's a big challenge to hold on an intensity basis.The business growing 20 percent is probably the biggest challenge that we have. We have projects on the books that will make a dent in that. But we do not have a full list of projects that get us to those goals by 2030.We'll have to develop those projects as we go. Some of them may require some new technology that's probably not commercial. But it's all been at least envisioned today.To get to the 2050 target, we'll have to do some things that, frankly, we're not even exactly sure what that would be right now. But in time, we think that that technology will become available and allow us to meet those targets.Fehrenbacher: These are technologies that can make the process more efficient? Or these are clean energy-powered technologies?Masters: Yeah, both of those. Some chemistry, some process development that would make us more efficient in making lithium. But also in clean energy.To get to our targets, we'll have to have a much stronger mix of clean energy than we do today. And those will be development projects, but also potentially just new projects.Green hydrogen is an example. That might be a way for us to reduce our footprint significantly if we had access to that in the locations where we operate. Carbon capture would be another way to do it, either participate as part of a big project or, or potentially even capture carbon from our facility.Fehrenbacher: In terms of powering operations and mining with clean energy, Is there a way to power a significant amount of operations? And how does that work?Masters: There are two pieces to that. Using solar power to help process the brine. So for example, in the Salar de Atacama in Chile most of the power that we use in concentrating the brines is solar power, through evaporation. That's why that solar footprint is much more sustainable than some of the other hardrock processing where you don't have the benefit of that solar power. So that's one piece.The other would just be solar power that we could access to power our facilities. So whether that is solar or wind or from green hydrogen we would either have to do a cogeneration type of facility, our own solar park as an example.\",\n",
              " 'The trucking industry is going through an unprecedented time of change.While this year\\'s lockdowns demonstrated the world\\'s reliance on trucking for critical groceries and e-commerce deliveries, the industry is also facing increased pressure to lower its emissions and adopt new technologies such as electric trucks and autonomous tech.?For commercial trucks, one of the best-known brands is Ryder, the almost 90-year-old Miami-based company that provides trucks and truck services for its more than 50,000 customers. While the bulk of Ryder\\'s close to 300,000 commercial vehicle fleet runs on diesel, the company operates around 900 alternative fuel vehicles, including 29 electric vehicles. Two years ago Ryder announced a 1,000 electric vehicle purchase order for FedEx.?GreenBiz (virtually) sat down with Ryder\\'s chief technology officer and vice president of new products for its fleet management services, Richard Mohr, to chat about how Ryder is making the transition to a cleaner fleet, including an electrified future. Mohr says: \"It¡¦s one of the most innovative times in the commercial trucking industry in the U.S. and that¡¦s going to increase in the future.\" This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.?Katie Fehrenbacher:?Where is Ryder now in 2020 in terms of the fleet and new technology?Richard Mohr: We¡¦re still primarily a diesel fleet just like the rest of the U.S. when it comes to heavy duty trucks. EV specifically, as a segment of alternative fuel, is probably the newest of all the alternative fuels in the U.S. We have a long history with natural gas as a low emissions fuel in the U.S. on the tractor side. So from that standpoint we¡¦ve been comfortable with maintaining alternative fuel vehicles for a long time.What¡¦s different about EV is it comes with its own set of challenges. Where EV comes into play, there¡¦s a lot more software and networking capabilities that need to be put into place to be able to run electric vehicles effectively. It¡¦s going to become more important, from a fueling standpoint, understanding the state of charge of what those vehicles is and what the state of charge that is going to be needed to operate your business.That¡¦s kind of the now and what we¡¦re looking at and certainly what we¡¦re investing in for resources and partnerships to prepare for that transition in the U.S.Fehrenbacher: When you look at the state of the electric truck market today, do you feel like it is breaking into the mainstream or is it still in the early stage research and development phase?Mohr: It¡¦s certainly in its early infancy. It¡¦s well behind the automotive segment on EVs. You only have a couple EV vehicles trucks that are in operations in the U.S. right now.Certainly, every OEM, traditional and non-traditional, has a game plan on how they¡¦re going to get to production. Certainly you¡¦re going to see this phase in over the next couple of years.We think that final-mile light duty is certainly the first segment that you¡¦re going to see the sooner growth in, because it fits the use case well with lots of start-stop, short and repetitive routes. What you¡¦re seeing in the press releases from Ryder is us starting to pilot those light duty vehicles. Specifically the Workhorse units that we¡¦re piloting in California right now and the units we¡¦re getting from the traditional OEMs, those are light duty in nature.We¡¦re piloting an electric tractor right now in California, but all of that is R&D and trying to determine duty cycles and usage of those vehicles and range and what applications start to make sense.It¡¦s certainly coming. You¡¦re starting to see a lot of the OEMs make significant investments in this because they know that there¡¦s going to be place for this product among other products that they sell whether its traditional ICE products or natural gas products or what they¡¦re seeing with the entrance to electric vehicles. It¡¦ll certainly pick up steam but it¡¦ll take awhile for us to get there.Fehrenbacher: What is the strategy of working with startups in that way?Mohr: We have the luxury of being fairly agnostic when it comes to OEMs that we deal with. We¡¦ll deal with OEMs that our customers want to use that product. But I think in the beginning, we¡¦re trying to get a mix of traditional and non-traditional OEMs to learn.There¡¦s a lot of innovation that is happening on the non-traditional side. You¡¦re seeing EV companies with composite bodies and trying to lower the weight of those vehicles to allow for the batteries. So you¡¦re seeing a lot of innovation that will end up lending itself to the traditional OEMs and how they change their manufacturing to accommodate for electric vehicles.Our biggest issue is being able to service vehicles. We want to make sure that for companies that we partner with, we have ample access to parts to be able to service those vehicles and maintain uptime on those vehicles for our customers. That is one of the biggest decision points when we¡¦re working with OEMs.Fehrenbacher: Are there goals or targets about introducing lower emission fleets for Ryder?Mohr: Not specifically on EVs right now. We do have goals around our corporate sustainability. That includes everything from what we do with oil and water and waste products.The reason why it¡¦s difficult to predict EVs right now is because we don¡¦t know when you¡¦re going to see large tranches of vehicles available to be deployed into the U.S. I can¡¦t even tell you right now how many units to anticipate being available on the market that are zero-emission EVs. No one knows right now. I can give you my best guess based on all of the OEM relationships I have.I have some internal goals of what I¡¦d like to get to this year and next year from a charging infrastructure and vehicle side, but those are personal goals that I¡¦m setting for the teams.Fehrenbacher: What¡¦s the biggest driving factor for changing the makeup of the fleet and investing in new vehicles?Mohr: As a fleet manager, you¡¦re looking at your total cost of ownership. That¡¦s the biggest decision that you¡¦re trying to make on whether you¡¦re moving to an EV or sticking with an internal combustion engine. Your total cost of ownership is everything from your vehicle acquisition cost, whether it¡¦s a lease or a purchase, including your fuel costs on that vehicle. On an EV, you have to take into considering your charging costs of that vehicle, your costs of electricity and your cost of the installation of electric.Unless you have some corporate goals around sustainability and trying to understand this market, a regular small business is probably not going to move into an EV until we can show that the total cost of ownership for that vehicle is going to outperform their traditional product.Fehrenbacher: Is there demand from your customers for alternative fuel vehicles?Mohr: Sure. We have a number of corporate advisory boards that are large customers with us and that¡¦s a topic that comes up all the time with them and what their goals are and how do they get prepared for this.You saw the 1,000 units that FedEx signed with us on electric vehicles. They¡¦re certainly a company that is preparing for that. And then you¡¦ve seen public orders with Tesla ¡X?it¡¦s mostly the large companies that have the infrastructure of the tolerance to spend some money right now to invest in this while they learn.Fehrenbacher: What are your thoughts on policy and regulation and specifically the Advanced Clean Truck rule?Mohr: I think there¡¦s two approaches in the U.S. The states can take a carrot or a stick approach to pushing EV standards. They can use the carrot, and provide incentives for businesses to offset the cost of this technology early to increase adoption. Or with the ACT rule, California just took the stick approach and said, \"This is gonna happen and here are the phased in times that it¡¦s going to happen at.\" So I think you¡¦re going to see a mix of those different strategies throughout the U.S. as states decide on how they want to position this on the commercial side.There were 13 states that signed onto the memorandum of understanding of the ACT. So we¡¦re looking at all of those states and how that impacts those states and how do we help customers get prepared for that. And then certainly there are still a lot of states that didn¡¦t sign onto that MOU that are also using incentives very efficiently to help businesses start to offset electrifying a fleet.Fehrenbacher: Have there been any incentives in any states that you¡¦ve found to be most helpful to your customers and Ryder?Mohr: The most useful incentives are coming from the local power companies around infrastructure. And that¡¦s bringing electricity to the curb that you need for electrification. And then helping with the offset of the hardware costs from bringing in charging. Those seem to be the most effective, because it¡¦s really infrastructure that you¡¦re going to need to operate those vehicles.I think offering incentives on the vehicles themselves, on bringing down the costs of that acquisition, is really something you do very early when those costs of vehicles are extremely high because they¡¦re so new. Eventually you¡¦re not going to have to offset the costs of the vehicles because they¡¦ll get in line with where they need to be.Fehrenbacher: What is Ryder¡¦s strategy around EV infrastructure? Is it to own and operate it?Mohr: We¡¦ve partnered with a company called In-Charge, a California-based company. They were funded by ABB, one of the largest electric hardware providers in the world, and Macquarie Capital, one of the largest private investment banks in the world. And we use In-Charge as our partner to help our customers with energy mitigation, the infrastructure grants, installation and engineering for our customers¡¦ facilities.Fehrenbacher: Have things changed around goals and plans for sustainability in the wake of COVID-19?Mohr: From a sustainability standpoint, it hasn¡¦t changed anything for us.Certainly it¡¦s a speed bump for new technology. You¡¦ve seen a little bit of a hiccup in timelines, but nothing that would affect us right now. You have certain EV providers that have slowed down for 30, 90, 120 days around manufacturing of production and releasing vehicles but nothing that would interrupt our business.',\n",

              " 'It helps to ensure a host of other environmental services, too, such as provision of clean air and water. But without significantly increased investment in tree nursery infrastructure, the U.S. will be unable to unlock its full reforestation potential, researchers?warn.Across the 48 states of the continental U.S., there are as many as 133 million acres?of reforestable land, an area more than twice the size of Oregon. New forests planted on those lands could sequester as much as 333 million metric tons of carbon every year. That¡¦s equivalent to about 5 percent?of the?greenhouse gases?the U.S. emitted in 2019.But to take advantage of just half that carbon sequestration potential over the next couple of decades, the country¡¦s tree nurseries will need to increase production more than 100 percent?in order to supply an additional 1.7 billion seedlings every year, according to a?study published online last month?in the journal?Frontiers in Forests and Global Change. Such a large increase in seedling production would require new investments in nursery infrastructure and workforce development.\"We found that we¡¦ll need to more than double the amount of seedlings that we produce in order to grow back forests,\" Joe Fargione, science director for North America with the NGO the Nature Conservancy and?lead author of the study, told Mongabay.While more than doubling seedling production sounds like a tall order, Fargione said U.S. nurseries were producing that many seedlings as recently as the late 1980s. Then shifting demand for domestic timber, consolidation in the commercial forestry industry and other factors led to a decline in U.S. nursery infrastructure. All of the 1.3 million seedlings?grown each year get planted and there¡¦s \"plenty of room\" for more, Fargione said.Fargione and his co-authors looked at how the U.S. might achieve a bold but feasible tree-planting target, which didn¡¦t necessarily mean replanting every single acre suitable for reforestation. \"We chose an ambitious scenario that we thought was illustrative,\" he says. The study looks at what it would take to reforest 64 million acres?by 2040.Based on interviews with foresters already working to replant forests, the researchers estimated that it would require 30 billion trees to reforest those 64 million acres, at a cost of 33 billion.However, that sum only covers the cost of collecting seeds, growing and planting seedlings and caring for newly planted trees (a critical step experts say is often skipped). It doesn¡¦t include the cost of expanding nursery infrastructure and developing a sufficient workforce to actually increase seedling production enough to meet the increased demand.In addition to foresters, Fargione and his team also surveyed nursery managers as part of the study to learn about the challenges nurseries would face in ramping up production so drastically. One of those nursery managers was Kimberly Wahl, a plant ecologist with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service¡¦s South Texas Refuge Complex, which has operated a habitat restoration program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge since the 1980s. Wahl told Mongabay that the complex¡¦s native plant nursery, built in 2004, \"had already been experiencing infrastructure issues, just because of how aged the facility had become.\"Those issues forced the nursery to scale back output and focus on repairs, Wahl said: \"Two years ago we grew around 100,000 seedlings. Last year we only grew 40,000, and that was because we were going to take a big step back and concentrate on repairing infrastructure so that we could come back really strong.\"The COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to those plans. \"That meant our production was low and we didn¡¦t get that infrastructure work done,\" Wahl noted.Although the pandemic has introduced new obstacles, post-pandemic economic recovery measures could present new solutions to the lack of a workforce in the U.S. capable of actually producing and planting 30 billion trees over the next two decades.\"I think there¡¦s an opportunity as we¡¦re looking at post-COVID employment programs to consider workforce development in this space,\" Fargione said. \"That was something we heard both on the nursery side and on the planting and post-planting maintenance side, that there¡¦s a need for workforce development.\"The Biden administration already has taken strong climate action, for instance by?canceling the controversial Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and re-entering the U.S. into the Paris climate agreement. It could do even more by committing to large-scale reforestation and taking steps to develop the necessary labor pool to plant and care for trees, Brian Kittler, senior director of forest restoration at the NGO American Forests and a co-author of the study, told Mongabay.\"Let¡¦s look at things like the Biden-Harris Administration¡¦s Civilian Climate Corps,\" Kittler said. The yet-to-be-defined jobs program does include a directive to \"increase reforestation,\" but no further details have been provided on what exactly that means. \"We should have people out there collecting seeds, banking them, preparing them, storing them long-term, and then working in nurseries to propagate those species in projects to get more nature back onto these landscapes.\"In conjunction with the release of the study, American Forests issued a?report?that details a range of strategies for scaling up U.S. nurseries¡¦ tree output. When it comes to financing more nursery infrastructure, Kittler said, \"A big opportunity that we see is that the federal government can step up and use the rural development programs that they currently have, like loan guarantees for agricultural businesses. The Farm Service Agency has other loan programs, and certainly the private sector could step forward.\"Robin Chazdon, an expert on forest regeneration who spent nearly 30 years as a professor at the University of Connecticut and is currently a research professor at Australia¡¦s University of the Sunshine Coast, said the study \"pointed out a really big issue. . Their data are good and they pulled together a lot of information that is important for projecting the capability for large-scale tree planting in this country.\"But one thing Chazdon, who was not involved in the study, said she thinks Fargione and his colleagues overlooked is the ability of forests to regrow on their own. \"They have this figure of 64 million acres?that are targets for reforestation, and they then make the assumption that 100 percent?of that should be reforested using planted trees ¡X even though they point out early in the paper that only one-third of U.S. Forest Service reforestation is actually planted, and most of it is natural regeneration.\"The researchers do note in the study that \"increasing severity and size of wildfires creates challenges for post-wildfire natural regeneration,\" and argue that, if anything, that increases the need for tree planting. They also acknowledge, \"The potential for restoring forest cover to these areas using natural regeneration will vary based on seed source proximity and abundance, climate, and land use.\"??As for who will pay to plant 64 million acres with trees by 2040, Fargione said, \"We¡¦re seeing interest in increased investment in the public sector at the federal, state?and municipal levels as people are increasingly concerned about climate change and they recognize ¡K the many benefits that trees provide. That includes storing more carbon but it also is wildlife habitat, it¡¦s also clean air, it¡¦s also holding the soil down, preventing erosion.\"He added: \"It¡¦s a pretty bipartisan issue. There¡¦s not an anti-tree lobby; most people appreciate trees.\"',\n",
              " 'With ESG gaining more attention and more companies committing to reaching net-zero emissions in the coming decades or otherwise pledging to do better by people and the planet, it¡¦s inevitable that the next generation of professionals in the field will define the future of sustainable finance.\"Finance professionals make up a fraction of the global population but are positioned to make and incentivize decisions that can shape the trajectory of the global economy,\" observed Ogechukwu Anyene, energy consulting manager at PowerAdvocate, who was part of the Emerging Leaders cohort at GreenBiz Group¡¦s inaugural GreenFin event.The Emerging Leaders program aims to foster a community of sustainability professionals that is diverse and representative of the world in which we live.¡§The Emerging Leaders program provides a forum where environmentally?focused youth can explore and learn about climate solutions and sustainability efforts across public and private sectors,¡¨ said Alex Liftman, global environmental executive at Bank of America, which sponsored the program at GreenFin. \"These students and young professionals are the next generation of both workforce and problem solvers.

There needs to be a standardized regulatory framework to clearly label what is sustainable and what is just behavior so that firms can respond to that and reconfigure their client offerings and portfolios to reflect those standards and progressive benchmarks. Financial institutions are powerful in fueling these changes, and many already are in that process. Nonetheless, additional education from leaders in the equity and sustainability fields can clarify the practical steps needed to assist players in the financial sector in meeting their organizational goals in these two areas while ensuring their behavior has the intended impact of making our world more equitable and sustainable.Blank scholar at UC Davis School of LawWith the current social and political climate and the broader push for sustainability across all sectors, it is without a doubt that sustainable finance is integral to propelling us into the greener future. Participating in this conference challenged me to think outside of my silo, learn about how different mechanisms work hand in hand, and pushed me to reimagine what it means to use existing (albeit imperfect) economic tools to prioritize equity and justice in the finance sector. This event has also made me realize the overlapping goals that both public and private actors possess and how integrated decision-making can really push society in the direction toward environmental equity, even if the approaches we offer may not be the same.?At the end, I have the privilege to participate in these processes and remain involved in this green transition. Ignoring the realities of climate change ¡X and recognizing the disparate impacts that environmental harms have on systemically vulnerable populations ¡X compels me to continue finding collaborative solutions and frameworks that can work for us all, the \"tide that lifts all boats.\"Associate, Corporate Engagement at CDPFinance has a lot of power in advancing a clean and more just economy through providing the capital for companies in order to transition to the low-carbon economy. In regards to GreenFin, I was particularly impressed with the amount of times that carbon pricing was brought up. There are challenges in terms of getting the right price, but I think that it¡¦s a very powerful tool in mitigating climate change. It is definitely something I will keep my eyes on. There was also a lot of talk on incorporating ESG in emerging markets, and I completely agree with that. We must ensure that when capital is redirected to the low-carbon economy, that emerging markets are incorporated as well. All in all, I really enjoyed the sessions put on by GreenFin, and can¡¦t wait to attend next year\\'s conference.Energy consulting manager at PowerAdvocateMy experience as an Emerging Leader at GreenFin 21 was engaging, insightful?and inspiring, to say the least. The conference truly contextualized the power of finance in promoting a clean, more just economy from a variety of vantage points. For example, within the investment value chain, investment managers can work with stakeholders such as asset managers and corporations to identify opportunities to financially back innovative and potentially transformative startups in the market aiming to advance a green and fair economy.My biggest takeaway from GreenFin21 is the responsibility that comes with a powerful, mobilizing force such as finance. Finance professionals make up a fraction of the global population but are positioned to make and incentivize decisions that can shape the trajectory of the global economy. That being the case, it is incumbent for the finance community as a whole to ensure that colleagues, portfolio companies?and more hold financial viability as well as ESG factors, in equal parity when doing business.Energy markets, Procurement & Sustainability Consultant at E&CProject appraisal is one of the key elements in the feasibility analysis of any initiative, which means that the financial health of any project or initiative is crucial for its forthcoming success. Tying in this analogy to our present-day world means that any economy¡¦s progress in the coming years would be driven by practices, policies and programs that are sustainable for our neighborhoods, our cities, our countries and our Earth. Therefore, an immediate conclusion that can be drawn from here is that financing a cleaner and greener economy is extremely essential. The plausible threats posed by changing weather patterns, melting glaciers, increasing emissions and declining animal and plant species can no longer be brushed under the carpet. And to reverse and prevent these phenomena, a lot of corrective initiatives and programs would have to be created and executed, which in turn are based on a strong financial foundation ¡X hence highlighting how powerful can \"finance\" be.??Advisor support associate at Horizons Sustainable Financial ServicesGreenFin21 provided a wealth of information and resources about the present and the future of sustainable finance. In a society that is hyper-focused on capital as the primary way people support themselves and engage with the world, it is only logical to surmise that there must be a way to employ financial power in transforming the economy. Over the two days of keynotes and breakout sessions, I learned that data is imperative for the success of bringing ESG values to the forefront of the economy. Businesses and financial institutions need to be convinced that there is equity in making sustainable choices. The pandemic spurred new energy and action into emphasizing ESG, which is encouraging. It was inspiring to hear about an acknowledgment that gender is relevant in all facets of finance, especially as a woman of color trying to find my place in this field. It was also exciting to hear about the work the Dallas Fort Worth airport is doing to make commitments to sustainable changes, because this kind of modeling will be imperative in making similar changes with other municipalities. This conference made me certain that brilliant strides are being made in environmental and climate concerns, and these strides are financially backed which will make all of the difference.Investments Leadership Development Program at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, U.S.Finance is essential for advancing a clean, more just economy. Many have cited the past year as an inflection point for sustainable investing. Institutional investors and individuals alike are displaying unprecedented interest in ESG due to a convergence of factors including the global health crisis and accelerating climate events.Coming face to face with inequalities exposed during the pandemic has forced leaders to address DEI in the workplace. Intensifying climate events like wildfires and rising sea levels have affected more people than ever. It is time to act ¡X and to act, we need finance. The financial sector touches all stakeholders, from businesses to consumers, and is the backbone of the economy.Sustainable finance can create long-term value by managing risks and returns, as well as by building more resilient systems for the future. Investors can intentionally invest in companies that have a positive social impact and exclude companies that do not. Investors can engage with businesses about their ESG practices. Investors can commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Finance spans all sectors and can be used in countless ways to advance a clean, more just economy.It is apparent that any organization that doesn¡¦t consider ESG will be exposed to future operational risks. The business case has been made, and stakeholder interests are now aligning. Finance is a powerful tool that can (and should) be actively used for good, to serve the communities in which we live and work.Global sustainability expert at SDG AdvocateFinancial institutions can unlock opportunities for under-resourced communities to join the fight against climate change, while supporting their bottom line. Through GreenFin 21, I have learned that investors that are best poised for the future are those that actively engage with companies through the \"power of purpose.\" Utilizing private funds that are funneled toward bridging the gap between social impact and environmental goals is key and has been demonstrated to be profitable for companies. The current green bonds used to offset GHG emissions can be expanded to identify a roadmap that supports individuals within a corporation¡¦s community or supply chain. Active engagement with your purpose means that there needs to be a development of thoughtful metrics, a roadmap for how to get there and constant reassessment of strategies implemented. The problem of how to tackle a just transition to a green economy can only be solved through reevaluation and is key in any ESG portfolio that wants to continuously see progress that serves a local or global community need.?MES candidate at the University of Pennsylvania & ESG Intern ¡X Artisan Sustainable Emerging Markets TeamGreenFin 21 was a great reminder that this is a fantastic time to be part of the sustainability realm and play a part in building and assuring a just, sustainable and inclusive economy worldwide in this decisive decade. The opportunity to meet such stellar emerging leaders and industry leaders was comforting as these remarkable people are leading and fighting the battle for a cleaner and equitable world. With such great minds at work, the hope is that it is only a function of time that sustainable finance will become mainstream.With the pandemic having aggravated income and social inequality globally, from the conversation at GreenFin 21, it is clear that many practitioners, financiers, regulators are slowly but progressively aligning and transitioning to a clean and just economy. My main takeaway was that in order to expedite action and transition, we must focus on ESG transparency and engagement. While finance can unlock many opportunities, stakeholders must actively initiate collaborative conversations and actions that consider the voices of the entire value chain, especially with those previously underrepresented and in the emerging world. Along with the focus on better disclosures, we must come together on action globally.GreenFin 21 validated that tremendous environmental, social and fiscal opportunities exist in redefining capitalism which can address social inequalities, injustices and climate change. Overall, it was reassuring to hear prominent not-for-profits, banks, asset holders, insurers and businesses talk about the power of finance that can support a value shift, turn pledges into progress, and that ESG is here to stay!Impact Investing and returned Peace Corps VolunteerI\\'ve learned that finance professionals can no longer sit on the sidelines and lean on our counterparts in the social sector to do the heavy lifting. It\\'s time we reframe our thinking about investing as more than an opportunity to create individual wealth. Sustainable finance is an opportunity to give our counterparts in the social sector the financial support they\\'ve needed for decades. It is about amplifying the voices and leaders that have been fighting for clean energy, civil rights and equitable healthcare for decades. Looking to these activists for technical assistance should be the norm in all ESG investing. I hope the finance industry will finally shed the vestiges of extractive capital creation and instead push to be boldly and unapologetically impactful.Sustainability Across the Curriculum intern, University of Georgia studentI once thought that utilizing finances in order to stabilize the circular economy relied on purely individual efforts ¡X?after all, each dollar spent is a choice that supports particular global supply chains, initiatives and resources. However, I have learned about the power of collaboration and of taking into account the differences between stakeholder and investor preferences in order to create a cleaner economy. Although interests may not align, the purchasing power of these groups can be harnessed to pinpoint cleaner financial decisions. As large investment firms push for the expansion of the green bond market, the public, private and nonprofit sectors may all benefit from cooperative efforts and linked supply chains when manufacturing and distributing products. I hope to see an increased push for carbon-neutral investments and economic structures that are available to people of all financial and social classes.I am honored to be selected as an emerging leader, and I had a wonderful time attending the sessions and the breakouts.Are you a student or young professional interested in advancing the circular economy? Applications for the Circularity 21 Emerging Leaders program are open until May 14.',\n",
              " 'When it comes to advancing a circular economy, innovators are working around the world with these three principles in mind ¡X design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use and regenerate natural systems.?During GreenBiz Group¡¦s Circularity 21, multiple examples of this were discussed on the main stage. There were the giants Amazon and Apple. And there were the startups that competed during the Accelerate competition. But behind the scenes, there are even more people doing this important work, including the Circularity 21 Emerging Leaders, a group of 12 students and early-career professionals looking to drive the transition to a circular economy.One of those Emerging Leaders is Arnaldo Perez-Negron, founder of zerodelivs, a zero-waste delivery service startup that is looking for investment to scale. (And he happened to connect with a VC in his city during a networking break at the virtual event.)\"It\\'s very exciting stuff. It\\'s hard. It\\'s very difficult. It\\'s a lot more complicated than I ever imagined ¡K but it\\'s a problem that I want to solve, and that\\'s why I\\'m tackling it,\" Perez-Negron said during one of the post-event discussions.After each day of Circularity 21, the event¡¦s cohort of Emerging Leaders gathered to discuss their takeaways and learnings from the day\\'s keynotes and breakout sessions.In addition to discussing general perceptions, during the last day¡¦s discussion, we zoomed out a bit, and I asked them what makes them excited about the circular economy as a whole and how they see their own work contributing to its acceleration.Below are excerpts from our post-event conversation ¡X along with written responses for Emerging Leaders who weren¡¦t able to attend the discussion. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.?Sustainability and Resiliency Specialist, Pinellas County in Florida; CEO/Founder, ZerodelivsThis whole concept of the circular economy is what got me into sustainability. I studied biomedical sciences for my bachelor\\'s degree. I even competed once to try to make a gamified recycling bin and stuff like that. So getting rid of plastic was like my gateway drug into sustainability. So I stayed with it, and I completely changed careers. And that\\'s why I did my master\\'s in environmental management and policy.?I was honestly really inspired at Circularity 21. And I loved the innovation part of it like during the Accelerate pitch session with that company called Made of Air. Like, what? It\\'s just mind-blowing stuff. Also, from the reusable packaging session called From Pilot to Scale, there was Tom Szaky there from Terracycle and Loop. One thing Tom said that kind of fueled me ¡X that unfortunately, the current gold standard of convenience is throwing things away. So all of us in this field need to find really innovative ways of replacing that and meeting that current gold standard of convenience if we really, really want to see a future circular economy. So I think it\\'s very possible. I\\'m personally working on it.?Change Agent Fellow, Black Girl Ventures; Chief Plastic Officer, Precious Plastic CincyOver the last year, I\\'ve been reading and on YouTube and trying to learn more. And I feel like I have more understanding of the methodologies and all of that, but I don\\'t think I knew there were people actively working on this who work at large corporations. And you hear ¡X I think it\\'s just marketing ¡X you hear about carbon capture and insert buzzy, climate tech here. But there are some truly practical solutions people were talking about. So it\\'s like, \"Oh, wait, I found my people.\" And there\\'s people to go along with all I\\'ve been learning. But on top of knowing the work is there, I found people working in this space and like-minded people who actually want to have conversations about solutions, rather than just \"Oh, yeah, I met you at a conference. See you next year.\" I\\'ve met a lot of people; I\\'m planning to meet up with them in the next two weeks.?Analyst, Lux Research; Contributor, Accelerating Materials Innovations teamThe circular economy cannot just be this one global big thing ¡X it needs to be smaller loops, and the local and regional levels that come together to build a global circular economy system almost has to be the system. And it was really interesting that a lot of the discussions through the event as well talked about the localization of innovation, localization of things like repair and recycling, to integrate the circular economy into the communities more and into cities, rather than thinking about countries and regions and continents. And so I think that the circular economy system really has a strong chance of starting and then growing, when it does start on those local levels, and starts off small, starts off with those measurable and immediately notable changes, so that people can get excited by it and kind of then progress towards those bigger, more disruptive changes.?Founder, Huri MovementFor me, getting into this field was about being able to look at everyone from an equitable stakeholder perspective, being able to actively involve people. And I always like to look at it as beginning with the end in mind. That\\'s what really got me fascinated with this industry. That\\'s what that means: asking the questions that most people sort of overlook. That\\'s what really allowed me to open up my eyes and say, \"What can we really look towards in terms of resilient infrastructure?\" Bringing it back to what keynote speaker Catherine Coleman Flowers mentioned. That\\'s what really drives me. That\\'s my passion. That\\'s my why. Being able to ask these questions, but most importantly, actively involving communities that are left out. I think the future of circular is bright, just as long as you remember that we have a responsibility for generations we haven\\'t seen. And as long as we can do that, and continue having conferences like this that give actionable steps towards what\\'s next, I think the sky\\'s the limit and we need to keep this going.?Incoming graduate student, Northwestern University; Research Assistant, Kellogg School of ManagementThe concept of a circular economy is exciting to me because of its impact potential on a corporate level. I\\'m sure we\\'ve all seen that statistic that almost two-thirds of GHG emissions are produced by just 100 companies. Ideally, you\\'d want them to reduce their environmental impact because it\\'s the right thing to do but that isn\\'t always the case. However, using principles from the circular economy, we can make a compelling business case for sustainable practices and create a resilient system while being more profitable overall. It\\'s an amazing opportunity for economic and sustainable development. To work towards this goal, I\\'m going to graduate school. I\\'ll be attending Northwestern University to obtain my Master of Science in Energy and Sustainability. I\\'m planning on concentrating in sustainable economics, so I can learn more about implementing circular economic principles across a variety of industries.?Policy Analyst, Environment and Climate Change CanadaI come from a policy perspective, when looking into circularity. Thinking about the keynote talk with George Bandy from Amazon . when we\\'re looking at a company like Amazon, that does have the investment, infrastructure and ability to make substantial change in its circular strategy and supply chain, I think for me that session really just outlined the importance of investment leading towards more value add in a circular infrastructure, and ensuring that companies like Amazon are with us through the process as we try to develop what the future circular economy will look like.?How that relates to the work I do ¡X right now, we\\'re really focused on trying to see what we can do in our hottest emitting sectors to get to net zero. And part of that is building up our circular economy, if that\\'s waste reduction, or looking to industries and seeing what we can do to reduce single use of various materials or plastics and whatnot. For me, this whole conference has been really eye-opening, and I got some ideas going in terms of how creative entrepreneurs, at the end of the day, want to commit to making impactful change towards our larger, sustainable and climate change objectives. So if anything it\\'s supplied me with a wealth of knowledge on how we become more critical as we continue to develop policies as we work towards net zero and our circular future.?Graduate, Parsons School of Design, The New School; Assistant Account Executive, EdelmanOne of the sessions that I really loved was habits and hooks ensuring consumer engagement. That was a really interesting one because they really focused on saying: It\\'s not just about the technical, but it\\'s also about storytelling and consumer engagement, and how the circular economy can\\'t really happen unless the individual plays an active role. All parties have to kind of participate. You can tell someone to recycle or participate in a take-back program, but it\\'s really about how you are going to tell the story and communicate this message to them that they should and how they should. I thought that was a really crucial part along with consumer engagement and just how we can encourage the individual to participate in circular initiatives.?MBA in Sustainability; Intern, Circular Value Chain Management and Commercial Operations, SignifyI\\'m actually taking an economics class right now. And so it was really interesting to approach this, essentially comparing the neoclassical approach of economics, which is like \"profit is king,\" and then looking at a newer framework that\\'s being developed before our eyes.?When I started the class, I had actually mentioned to my professor my interest in the circular economy. And he has his Ph.D. in economics, and he said that the circular economy in his opinion is \"all bark, no bite\" because there\\'s a lot of people talking about what needs to be done, but not really how it has to be done. That took me by surprise because with my engineering background, I understood fundamentally why this was necessary. In the design stage, I know exactly where we can kind of plug some of this in, but then hearing an economist¡¦s perspective made me nervous entering this conference, because I\\'m like, \"Wow, is this really like all bark, no bite?\" But luckily, a majority of the sessions had the technical aspects being highlighted and showing that it has to be an integrated process for the circular economy to really take off. We can\\'t just talk about this from a business perspective without understanding the finite resources that we\\'re dealing with.?Masters Student, Regenerative Sustainability, University of SaskatchewanWhat really excites me about the circular economy is basically the idea around making use of what we already have, which was actually my takeaway from this whole experience. There was a lot of emphasis on reusing or trying to repair what we already have on the ground or even taking inspiration from nature, mimicking nature.?For example, what Spintex is doing ¡X imitating the mechanism from studying the spider and using that to create materials that can be used in the fashion industry. And talking about the fashion industry, having worked in the fashion industry for over a year and seeing how the processes from the design team, to the manufacturers, and creating samples and prototypes, and seeing how much waste is being generated ¡K that was actually what drew my attention to the concept of sustainability and the importance of creating a circular economy. Having that in mind, I feel it\\'s very important for us to be able to innovate new ideas on how we can make use of what we already have and utilize that. And also think of how we can build upon that to create things that can sustain us longer without causing more harm to the environment.?Recent BS in Earth, Society and Environmental Sustainability; Consultant, Circular Economy Projects, Plant ChicagoI loved the concept of endineering. And I think it\\'s really true that a lot of our products today, and the overuse of resources and large amounts of waste is because we don\\'t really design for the end. We don\\'t consider what would happen within the infrastructures that we have.??Recent UCLA graduate; Intern, Partnership and Sustainability, PatchEditor¡¦s note: Wu is referring to a breakout session that touched on the potential global treaty on plastic pollution. One of the speakers mentioned the Montreal Protocol and the banning of DDT dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, a synthetic insecticide. And it is really awesome to hear him say that?because those were turning points in our path towards a better climate. And I think that thinking about plastics, and what could potentially happen on a global level to eradicate this issue, is really exciting in the same way that we worked together to close the ozone hole. And we worked together to ban DDT and all these kinds of things. So the fact that people are working on it already, and that there are such inspiring people making these decisions now, is really awesome, because it kind of gives me hope that maybe when we\\'re all in the midst of our careers, maybe we won\\'t have such massive issues to deal with. And maybe it will be better than it is now.??Ph.D. Student, Innovation Fellow, Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College; Internet, Sustainability, Stanley Black & DeckerMy research focuses on enabling the integration of sustainability in industry product development practice. I build methodological frameworks and computational tools to help tailor various sustainable design strategies (including circularity) to a company¡¦s context, goals?and workflow.\"What if humans designed products and systems that celebrate an abundance of human creativity, culture and productivity? That are so intelligent and safe, our species leaves an ecological footprint to delight in, not lament?\" Michael Braungart in this quote sums up the immense potential we hold to make life better for ourselves and for the planet, if we commit to changing the way we currently do things.The circular economy to me is a key avenue to achieve this vision of a greener, safer and more harmonious planet. I believe that we need a diverse coalition of people to solve the complex climate challenges that lie ahead.',\n",
              " 'I¡¦m not going to weigh in on whether COP26, the climate conference that concluded over the weekend in Glasgow, Scotland, was a success or failure. There is no shortage of opinions on both sides of that equation, a debate that will no doubt rage right up until COP27, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, next November.There were some decidedly positive developments: For the first time, nature is firmly on the climate agenda. The critical role of achieving the 1.5 degrees Celsius degree goal is now baked into the negotiations. The event recognized and advanced the role of Indigenous and local communities. It provided a rulebook for international cooperation through carbon markets. And it formally recognized the need to put an end to fossil fuels, even if it didn¡¦t offer a decisive plan to do so.But not everyone agreed. The final negotiated agreement was called \"shameful\" (Indigenous Environmental Network), \"a betrayal to the millions of people suffering from the climate crisis in developing countries\" (Climate Action Now) and a \"disappointing end\" (Sierra Club).Good COP/Bad COP, and all that.I¡¦m a Glasgow-half-full kind of guy, so I¡¦ve been focused on the business leadership that permeated the two-week event, about which I previously wrote. But much more has happened since I wrote that, a seemingly long seven days ago.As the Financial Review put it:That shift is unmistakable. Witness these business initiatives ¡X many in partnership with governments around the world ¡X announced over the past two weeks.The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ¡X GFANZ, for short ¡X spearheaded by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, announced it has more than 130 trillion in assets under management, presenting 40 percent of the world¡¦s total financial assets and managed by 450 firms across 45 nations. It was the largest financial commitment by far at COP.GFANZ members are required to transition their portfolios in line with the Paris Agreement and are being pushed to work towards 1.5C-degree rather than 2C-degree temperature pathways.After great anticipation, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation announced a new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which will merge the Climate Disclosure Standards Board and the Value Reporting Foundation. ISSB intends to have the climate standards ready to go by next April.As BSR CEO Aron Cramer noted, the new body \"will advance with the objective of achieving comparable, consistent and reliable disclosures on climate and other sustainability issues.\" It will \"align incentives, promote wider uptake and enable comparability,\" he said, as well allocate capital by investors to companies that embrace a long-term approach.A First Movers Coalition was launched, \"a new platform for companies to harness their purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies that are key for tackling the climate crisis.\" Seven chosen sectors ¡X steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals, shipping, aviation and trucking ¡X account for more than a third of global carbon emissions but do not have cost-competitive alternatives to fossil fuels. The eighth, direct air capture, could cut atmospheric CO2 levels to help achieve net-zero global emissions.Founding members include Airbus, Amazon, Apple, Bank of America, Boston Consulting Group, Boeing, Cemex, Delta Air Lines, DHL Group, Engie, Fortescue Metals Group, Holcim, Johnson Controls, Mahindra Group, Nokia, ?rsted, Salesforce, Scania, Trane, United Airlines, Vattenfall, Volvo and Yara International.More than 40 companies signed up to the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, pledging to take increased action to decarbonize the built environment across their portfolios and business activities, representing annual revenue of 85 billion. By the end of the decade, these companies pledge to reduce all operational emissions of new and existing buildings; achieve maximum reductions in embodied carbon for new developments and major renovations over which they have direct control; compensate for any residual operational and upfront embodied emissions that cannot be mitigated; and advocate for wider emission reductions via their business activities and report on their impact, to enable and accelerate the sector wide transition to net zero.The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, which aims to bring together the purchasing power of buyers for alternative fuels and to encourage policy support, opened to new members for the first time. Eighty signatories ¡X both airlines and large travel buyers ¡X have committed to boost the use of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to 10 percent of the global jet fuel demand by 2030.Twenty airline members of the World Economic Forum¡¦s Target True Zero initiative committed to use new technologies, such as electric, hydrogen and hybrid aircraft, to reduce aviation¡¦s climate footprint. The signatory airlines operate more than 800 aircraft and carry more than 177 million passengers a year and hope to use this influence to create market demand for new types of aircraft. The initiative will prioritize short-haul flights, the easiest to electrify, before turning to longer-range flights.Oceangoing shipping embarked on a cleaner voyage. More than 20 national governments signed the Clydebank Declaration for Green Shipping Corridors (the River Clyde flows through the heart of Glasgow) to develop zero-emission shipping routes between ports. These so-called green shipping corridors will act as a testbed for emerging technologies. The aim is to establish at least six corridors by the mid-2020s, which are likely to be shorter routes, and to add \"many more routes,\" including long-haul routes, by 2030.Meanwhile, the Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies within the maritime, energy, infrastructure and finance sectors, identified 10 primary shipping corridors that have a high potential for policymaker action. It also issued a call to action for policymakers to set overarching net-zero targets for the sector with pre-2050 deadlines so that zero-emissions options are the default by 2030.A group of 28 companies spanning the mining, manufacturing and financial sectors pledged to grow both the demand and supply of green hydrogen. The pledges will create a demand of 1.6 million tons annually of \"lower-carbon intensity\" hydrogen. This includes replacing grey hydrogen used in refining, chemical and fertilizer sectors, or diesel fuel used in heavy industries such as mining. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 14 million tons a year.A group of countries, companies and cities committed to phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles by 2040, as part of efforts to cut carbon emissions and curb global warming. The Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans aims to rapidly accelerate the transition to low-carbon emission vehicles and aims to make \"all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission by 2040 or earlier, or by no later than 2035 in leading markets.\"Signatories include the U.K., Luxembourg, Rwanda, the Australian Capital Territory, California and three of its cities, Buenos Aires, six South Korean provinces and cities, the Indian Chamber of Commerce and corporate partners Volvo, Daimler, General Motors, Ford, IKEA, Siemens and Uber.A commitment to halt deforestation while restoring land degradation by 2030 has been described as a landmark moment for nature and has been agreed to by more than 100 nations and 30 financial institutions. This represents more than 85 percent of forests globally.The pledge is backed by nearly 20 billion in public and private funding, including 7.2 billion of newly mobilized private-sector funding. CEOs from more than 30 financial institutions with more than 8.7 trillion of assets under management ¡X including Aviva, Schroders and Axa ¡X also committed to eliminate investment in activities linked to deforestation.The governments of Canada, India, Germany and the U.K. pledged to purchase low-carbon-emission steel and concrete as part of the Industrial Deep Decarbonization Initiative (IDDI). These two materials account for up to 16 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. The public procurement of steel and cement in these countries represents 25 to 40 percent of the domestic market.Within the next three years, IDDI aims to have at least 10 countries commit to purchasing low-carbon concrete and steel. The initiative will also help countries align their public procurement policies with their steel and concrete purchasing pledges.More than 100 countries representing more than two-thirds of the global economy, including the United States, Japan and Canada, pledged to significantly cut emissions of methane, a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas. The Global Methane Pledge commits signatories to reducing their overall emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. The initiative emphasizes making cuts by tackling methane leaking from oil and gas wells, pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure.Other announcements include:Not bad for a fortnight¡¦s work (plus, no doubt, years of collaboration and negotiation). No one is saying these initiatives are sufficient, but they represent a solid foundation on which to increase ambition and action in this decisive decade.I¡¦ll give the last word to a COP veteran, former Unilever CEO Paul Polman:And, it seems, it has.',\n",

              " 'On Aug. 18, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it will end use of chlorpyrifos ¡X a pesticide associated with neurodevelopmental problems and impaired brain function in children ¡X on all food products nationwide. Gina Solomon, a principal investigator at the Public Health Institute, clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco and former deputy secretary at the California Environmental Protection Agency, explains the scientific evidence that led California to ban chlorpyrifos in 2020 and why the EPA is following suit.Chlorpyrifos is an inexpensive and effective pesticide that has been on the market since 1965. According to the EPA, about?5.1 million pounds of chlorpyrifos have been used annually in recent years (2014-2018) on a wide range of crops, including many vegetables, corn, soybeans, cotton and fruit and nut trees.Like other organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos is designed to kill insects by blocking an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme normally breaks down acetylcholine, a chemical that the body uses to transmit nerve impulses. Blocking the enzyme causes insects to have convulsions and die. All organophosphate insecticides are also toxic and potentially lethal to humans.Until 2000, chlorpyrifos was also used in homes for pest control. It was banned for indoor use after passage of the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which required additional protection of children¡¦s health. Residues left after indoor use were quite high, and toddlers who crawled on the floor and put their hands in their mouth were found to be at risk of poisoning.Despite the ban on household use and the fact that chlorpyrifos doesn¡¦t linger in the body, over 75 percent of people in the U.S. still have traces of chlorpyrifos in their bodies, mostly due to residues on food. Higher exposures have been documented in farm workers and people who live or work near agricultural fields.Researchers published the first study linking chlorpyrifos to potential developmental harm in children in 2003. They found that higher levels of a chlorpyrifos metabolite ¡X a substance produced when the body breaks down the pesticide ¡X in umbilical cord blood were significantly associated with smaller infant birth weight and length.Subsequent studies published from 2006 to 2014 showed that those same infants had developmental delays that persisted into childhood, with lower scores on standard tests of development and changes that researchers could see on MRI scans of the children¡¦s brains. Scientists also discovered that a genetic subtype of a common metabolic enzyme in pregnant women increased the likelihood that their children would experience neurodevelopmental delays.These findings touched off a battle to protect children from chlorpyrifos. Some scientists were skeptical of results from epidemiological studies that followed the children of pregnant women with greater or lesser levels of chlorpyrifos in their urine or cord blood and looked for adverse effects.Epidemiological studies can provide powerful evidence that something is harmful to humans, but results can also be muddled by gaps in information about the timing and level of exposures. They also can be complicated by exposures to other harmful substances through diet, personal habits, homes, communities and workplaces.As evidence accumulated that low levels of chlorpyrifos were probably toxic to humans, regulatory scientists at the EPA and in California reviewed it ¡X but they took very different paths.At first, both groups focused on the established toxicity mechanism: acetylcholinesterase inhibition. They reasoned that preventing significant disruption of this key enzyme would protect people from any other neurological effects.Scientists working under contract for Dow Chemical, which manufactured chlorpyrifos, published a complex model in 2014 to estimate how much of the pesticide a person would have to consume or inhale to trigger acetylcholinesterase inhibition. But some of their equations were based on data from as few as six healthy adults who had swallowed capsules of chlorpyrifos during experiments in the 1970s and early 1980s ¡X a research method that now would be considered unethical.California scientists questioned whether risk assessments based on the Dow-funded model adequately accounted for uncertainty and human variability. They also wondered whether acetylcholinesterase inhibition was really the most sensitive biological effect.In 2016 the EPA released a reassessment of chlorpyrifos¡¦s potential health effects that took a very different approach. It focused on epidemiological studies published from 2003 through 2014 at Columbia University that found developmental impacts in children exposed to chlorpyrifos. The Columbia researchers analyzed chlorpyrifos levels in the umbilical cord blood at birth, and the EPA attempted to back-calculate how much chlorpyrifos the babies might have been exposed to throughout pregnancy.On the basis of this analysis, the Obama administration concluded that chlorpyrifos could not be safely used and should be banned. However, the Trump administration halted this decision one year later, arguing that the science was not resolved and more study was needed. The Trump administration subsequently abandoned the human epidemiological studies and reverted to using the Dow-sponsored model and acetylcholinesterase inhibition endpoint used back in 2014.History indicates that both political and scientific considerations likely accounted for the long delays. Although the conclusions clearly shifted with federal administrations, the epidemiological studies and the acetylcholinesterase model also pointed in different directions ¡X one suggested high health risks in humans, and the other suggested relatively lower risks. Policy conclusions thus depended partly on which data scientists chose as the basis for evaluating health risks.Three new papers on prenatal exposures to chlorpyrifos, published in 2017 and 2018, broke the logjam. These were independent studies, conducted on rats, that evaluated subtle effects on learning and development.The results were consistent and clear: Chlorpyrifos caused decreased learning, hyperactivity and anxiety in rat pups at doses lower than those that affected acetylcholinesterase. And these studies clearly quantified doses to the rats, so there was no uncertainty about their exposure levels during pregnancy. The results were eerily similar to effects seen in human epidemiological studies, vindicating serious health concerns about chlorpyrifos.California reassessed chlorpyrifos, using these new studies. Regulators concluded that the pesticide posed significant risks that could not be mitigated, especially among people who lived near agricultural fields where it was used. In October 2019, the state announced that under an enforceable agreement with manufacturers, all sales of chlorpyrifos to California growers would end by Feb. 6, 2020, and growers would not be allowed to possess or use it after Dec. 31, 2020.Two months after the California decision, the European Union voted to ban chlorpyrifos due to concerns about neurodevelopmental harm. New York, Hawaii, Oregon and Maryland also moved to end use of the pesticide within their borders. On the same day that California sales of the pesticide ceased, the main manufacturer of chlorpyrifos, Corteva Agrosciences, announced that it would stop producing the chemical.This saga began in 2007, when the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network formally petitioned the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos, citing epidemiological evidence that the chemical caused harm to brain development. (I worked at NRDC at the time and reviewed scientific studies on chlorpyrifos, but was not directly involved with the petition.)Over a decade passed while the agency reevaluated the science, studying multiple ways of analyzing the data. In 2016 the EPA proposed to grant the petition and ban chlorpyrifos, but did not complete this action by the end of the Obama administration.In July 2019, under the Trump administration, the EPA denied the petition, saying that claims about neurodevelopmental toxicity were \"not supported by valid, complete and reliable evidence.\" Nonetheless, a new EPA risk assessment released in 2020 identified significant risks associated with combined exposures to chlorpyrifos from multiple sources, including food and drinking water.In late April, a federal court in California ordered the agency to either ban use of chlorpyrifos on food within 60 days or show that it was safe. \"The EPA has had nearly 14 years to publish a legally sufficient response to the 2007 Petition,\" the ruling stated. \"During that time, the EPA¡¦s egregious delay exposed a generation of American children to unsafe levels of chlorpyrifos.\"With the agency¡¦s Aug. 18 announcement, that delay is finally over.',\n",
              " 'It¡¦s no secret that the diversity of life around us is plummeting fast. In 2020 alone, scientists declared more than 100 species to be extinct. And that¡¦s bad news not only for the creatures themselves, but for those of us (that would be all of us) who rely on them for food, to produce oxygen, to hold soil in place, to cleanse water, to beautify our world and so much more. According to the World Economic Forum, nature plays a key role in generating more than half of global GDP.So, what can we do to reduce future harm? One big thing is to identify emerging threats and opportunities to protect biodiversity and proactively shape policies and actions to prevent harm early on. To this end, a group of scientists and conservation practitioners led by William Sutherland, professor of conservation biology at the University of Cambridge, each year creates and publishes a \"horizon scan\" of global trends with impacts for biodiversity. Read on for this year¡¦s top picks, and see our coverage of previous years¡¦ horizon scans here or at the bottom of this page.One big challenge for solar power is finding a place to put large arrays of photovoltaic panels. In recent years the notion of siting them on water rather than land has taken off dramatically, with more than 300 installations in place around the world today. The approach offers a number of benefits to biodiversity. For one, it saves land resources that might otherwise be covered with solar panels. It can reduce algal blooms on waterways. It can reduce the demand for other habitat-harming energy sources such as hydropower, and the evaporative cooling water offers makes the panels more efficient. All that said, still to be determined are the potential implications ¡X positive and negative ¡X for aquatic and marine ecosystems.Powerlines and the poles and towers that hold them are staples of civilization. Imagine being able to replace them with devices that transmit electricity through the air instead of along wires? That vision is closer to becoming reality, thanks to innovations in materials and in technologies that create and direct beams of energy ¡X think wireless smartphone charging writ large. Deployment of long-distance wireless energy infrastructure could reduce the harms that conventional hardware pose to wildlife, such as collision risks for birds and bats. On the downside, it could also stimulate energy use and make it easier to live in remote locations, hastening the destruction or disruption of our planet¡¦s few remaining untrammeled areas.Think human impacts on biodiversity are limited to the biosphere? Think again. More than 2,000 communications satellites currently orbit our planet, and with current plans, the total could reach 100,000 in the next 10 years. The process of deploying and decommissioning these extraplanetary objects can disrupt the stratospheric ozone layer; deposit aluminum in, and otherwise modify the chemical composition of, the upper atmosphere; and alters Earth¡¦s albedo ¡X its ability to reflect sunlight. These alterations in turn affect the amount and type of radiation that hits the surface of our planet. As satellite deployment soars, implications potentially loom large for climate, exposure to ultraviolet light and other conditions that affect the well-being of living things.The pursuit of alternative transportation fuels has taken many twists and turns, all with ancillary costs as well as benefits. Recent attention has turned to ammonia as a fuel for shipping. It can power fuel cells or engines. It has almost doubled the energy density of hydrogen, and poses fewer issues related to storage and transporting fuel to where it¡¦s needed. The problem? Ammonia takes lots of energy to produce and can cause environmental harm if not burned completely. As interest in ammonia fuel grows, the authors warn against false claims of it being a \"zero carbon\" fuel and potential downsides, such as increased air pollution, that might accrue from its use.Increasingly sophisticated tools for detecting and identifying DNA are able to pinpoint the presence ¡X or even past presence ¡X of all kinds of organisms from bits of their genetic material floating through the air. This capability opens the door to a wide range of conservation-assisting endeavors, from characterizing the members of a particular ecological community, to locating rare or endangered species, to tracking the expansion of the range of invasive organisms, to nailing perpetrators of illegal wildlife trade. So-called \"eDNA\" biomonitoring is already in use for detecting the presence of microorganisms, plants and fungi, and it appears to be feasible for tracking some animals as well. As the technology expands, so likely will the applications to efforts to understand and protect biodiversity.Widespread efforts have taken place in recent decades to reduce use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling systems due to their capacity to contribute to global warming. Unfortunately, one of the top kinds of replacement chemicals, hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), appear to have plenty of environmental issues of their own. As they decompose, HFOs form chemicals that pollute water and air. Some produce potent greenhouse gases. Environmental contamination with this long-lasting HFC substitute appears to on the rise. Unless regulation related to the deployment and decommissioning of refrigerants quickly and dramatically improves, we risk further contributing to climate change with a shift in practice intended to help reduce its risks.Production of clinker, a key ingredient of cement, is bad for the climate and bad for biodiversity. It requires mining limestone, harming habitat for living things. And the process of turning limestone into clinker releases huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide ¡X both from the energy required to heat it up, and from the carbon dioxide limestone releases in the process. Cement production already is responsible for some 8 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and demand for cement is expected to grow. Using volcanic material in place of limestone could reduce greenhouse gas impact and would have additional benefit of possibly improving the ability of cement resist cracking. However, the authors write, we need to weight the environmental costs of mining and transporting volcanic material against the benefits of reducing limestone use.Neonicotinoids are a class of chemicals that kill insects by disabling their nervous systems. Used to control pests in agriculture, they have come under fire in recent years for threatening populations of bees and other desirable insects. As neonicotinoids have been banned in the European Union and elsewhere, other, similar-acting insecticides have emerged. These substitutes, including sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone, appear also to harm bees and some other desirable insect species, potentially posing new threats to insect biodiversity.Some insects and other invertebrates have evolved a novel solution to their \"can¡¦t find a date\" problem: They can reproduce without sex. The process, known as parthenogenesis, allows them to make more of their species when mates are scarce or absent. It also dramatically enhances their ability to gain a foothold in new territory if accidentally introduced there. At least one invertebrate, the marbled crayfish, evolved the ability to reproduce asexually in captivity and is spreading rapidly across Europe, Africa and Asia, carrying with it disease that harms native species. As we cultivate other invertebrates for food or hobbies, we raise the risk that something similar might happen with other species.Animal agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and \"plant-forward\" diets are gaining increased attention as a way to not only be healthier ourselves but to help our planet be healthier as well. China, for one, is taking it a step further: Rather than simply touting meals heavy on fruits and veggies, it has committed to cut its citizens¡¦ meat consumption in half by 2030. Media campaigns and meat bans in some settings already have contributed to a decline in meat consumption, and the initiative has boosted innovations around synthetic meats, with the country¡¦s plant-based meat industry expected to grow 20¡V25 percent per year in the foreseeable future.Volunteer groups, nonprofit organizations, small-town governments and other local entities can be a valuable source of support for people living in rural areas. It turns out they can be a valuable source of support for other living things, too. Globally, the number of social institutions has grown from half a million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2020, providing support for sustainable management of some 700 million acres of forests, farmland and waterways. If this trend continues, it bodes well for biodiversity conservation as more lands are managed in ways that keep them ¡X and the plants and animals that inhabit them ¡X thriving.The East Asian¡VAustralasian Flyway, which extends along the eastern coast of Asia and Australia through New Zealand, is one of the top hot spots in the world for diversity and sheer numbers of waterfowl and other water-loving birds, including critically endangered species. With massive development underway in China ¡X one of the top wetland-containing nations in the world ¡X it¡¦s also among the most threatened: In the past decade, many wetland areas have been transformed into farmland and cities. Recently, however, several changes are starting to shine an optimistic light. The United Nations has provided a new level of protection to highly significant wetlands in Korea and China by adding them to its roster of World Heritage Sites. And China itself has begun investing in protecting key wetlands. If this trend continues and other countries follow suit, it could spell welcome relief for water birds throughout much of eastern Asia and the western Pacific.The mangrove forests that coat coastlines in the tropics and subtropics harbor abundant plant and animal species that thrive at the intersection of land and sea. In past decades development has decimated many, destroying the biodiversity-nurturing and carbon-sequestering services they provide. But in recent years that tide has turned. Conservationists¡¦ efforts to restore and preserve these rich habitats have helped reduce loss. In addition, these wetlands are also the accidental beneficiaries of other ecosystem changes: As inland forests are cut, erosion moves soil toward the coast where it can nurture new mangroves, and climate change is creating more of the warm habitat they need. Together, these changes have reduced mangrove loss to near zero, although local areas of depletion continue.Intertidal zones ¡X the portions of the ocean¡¦s coast across which water advances and recedes with the tides ¡X experience daily fluctuations in temperature, water level, salinity, physical disruption and predation. Now, they are seeing another variable: heat waves. Record temperatures in Pacific Northwest in June left mussels, clams, oysters, barnacles, sea stars, rockweed and more dead along thousands of miles of coastline. And that¡¦s not all. Climate change threatens to change salinity of these complex and fragile ecosystems as well, as precipitation patterns change and polar ice melts. If this keeps up we¡¦ll have more than a stinky mess: The complex ecosystems and the services they provide ¡X stabilizing coasts, providing food, providing habitat, protecting water quality ¡X will be fried, too.The seabed beneath Earth¡¦s oceans harbors abundant bounties of precious metals and other mineable materials. New technologies have made it possible to mine such materials, and one country, Nauru, recently announced plans to permit deep-sea mining. This announcement means that the International Seabed Authority must either set up specific ocean mining regulations or commit to reviewing applications under established, more general United Nations conventions. Ocean mining may reduce pressure to disrupt land habitat ¡X but it also opens the door to new assaults on unique deep-sea ecosystems and the living things they harbor.',\n",
              " 'For Gershon Grossman and Ed Murray, 1978 was a big year. Grossman, then a solar energy pioneer at the Technion, Israel¡¦s premier technological institute, was launching the first International Conference on the Application of Solar Energy. Murray, an idealist attending college, joined an upstart solar heating company in Sacramento, California¡¦s capital, drawn by a prescient concern about climate change and, as he puts it, an impulse to \"save the world.\"For both, the excitement was palpable. Solar water heaters were surging into the market, solar thermal energy showed broad potential, and the two were riding the wave.Four decades later, however, they live in two different worlds. In Israel, 85 percent of households get hot water from a dud shemesh, or \"sun boiler.\" But in the U.S., despite decades of advocacy by Murray and others, the number of households that have a solar water heater is less than 1 percent. In California, many people don¡¦t even know the technology exists.America¡¦s solar water heating deficit is often portrayed as a historical accident driven by the vagaries of politics and comparatively cheap fossil fuels. However, interviews with academic and commercial players on the front lines of the solar thermal industry, and a recent in-depth report on the now-expired California Solar Initiative¡VThermal (CSI-T) program, suggest that the desire for simple, \"magic bullet\" solutions to climate change also has played a significant role in relegating this practical technology to the sidelines.Heating water accounts for 25 percent of residential energy use worldwide, mostly achieved by burning fossil fuels. Solar water heaters do the job without combustion. Unlike solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which convert sunlight into electricity, solar thermal systems collect solar energy as heat.?Solar water heaters transfer this heat to water in a holding tank. Other energy sources, such as natural gas or electricity from a power grid, serve as a backup for cloudy days.By tapping the sun, solar water heaters can reduce a household¡¦s water heating fuel consumption 50 percent to 70 percent. Israel is just one of dozens of countries with a variety of climates where this technology has been deployed. Solid performance and wide applicability have made the technology one of Project Drawdown¡¦s top 50 climate change solutions.So why did solar thermal technology soar in Israel and sputter in California, setting Grossman and Murray on such different life paths? A pair of political decisions in the 1970s and 1980s had dramatic impact.The Yom Kippur War of 1973 and subsequent oil embargo made energy independence a matter of national security worldwide, but the pinch was particularly painful in countries lacking oil production. For Israel, the threat was existential; as former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir famously quipped, \"Moses took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil.\" In 1976, Israel mandated solar water heaters for all new residential buildings up to eight stories tall ¡X a mandate extended to all residential buildings last December.For Grossman, now a professor emeritus at the Technion and head of the Energy Forum at the Neaman Institute for National Policy Research, mandating solar water heaters made sense environmentally, even beyond Israel¡¦s political agenda. \"You just can¡¦t argue with the numbers on how much?energy you can save using solar water heating instead of electrical heating.\"The U.S. also felt the jolt of the oil embargo and feared running out of domestic oil. Supported by President Jimmy Carter¡¦s 1978 federal tax credits for renewable energy, Americans installed nearly 1 million solar thermal systems by 1990, supplied by more than 200 U.S. manufacturers, including leading corporations such as Grumman Aerospace Corporation and Sears Roebuck.?Renewable solar heats 85 percent of households in Israel, who get hot water from a dud shemesh, or \"sun boiler.\" In the U.S., it¡¦s a different story. Photo courtesy of Yaniv Hassidof.However, in contrast to Israel, America¡¦s commitment to renewable energy proved ephemeral. Under President Ronald Reagan, the federal incentives lapsed, dealing the solar thermal industry a body-blow. \"We went from 650 companies in California that were installing solar water heaters to about 37 overnight,\" recalls Murray, currently president and CEO of two California companies dedicated to manufacturing, distributing and installing solar thermal systems, as well as president of the California Solar and Storage Association.Recent attempts to revive the residential solar water heater industry have had limited success. The CSI-T program, begun in 2010 as a larger push to incentivize solar installations statewide, aimed to add 200,000 systems, but received only 6,237 applications for residential retrofits in 10 years, according to the program¡¦s December report. \"I could put a sign over the front door of my office that says ¡¥free solar water heating,¡¦ and they¡¦d probably still stay away in droves,\" Murray says with a wry laugh.Larger installations for apartment complexes, hotels and universities and home pool heating have helped keep Murray¡¦s solar thermal businesses afloat despite the lack of other residential demand. Ironically, the commercial sector isn¡¦t as robust in Israel because the country¡¦s original mandate only applied to residential properties ¡X a move Grossman views as a significant oversight. Indeed, Grossman believes that an industrial mandate could increase Israel¡¦s renewables usage up to fivefold.The woes of the American solar water heater industry go far beyond politics, however. The industry also suffers a more insidious challenge: For the average consumer, \"going solar\" means just one thing: solar PV.?Solar thermal technologies, including solar water heating, provide a direct, thermodynamically efficient and cost-effective method for decarbonizing heating. And for households in mild climates with low electricity bills, \"solar water heating can be one of the simplest ways ¡K to use renewable energy and save on energy bills,\" says the CSI-T report.But solar PV has exploded into the global electricity sector, thanks to manufacturing innovations and strong government support. Leveraging economies of scale, the price of solar PV panels has dropped by over an order of magnitude in the past decade. In California, additional boosts came from government-instituted solar feed-in tariffs, cheap financing plans and private-sector investments. And, in a major coup for the industry, California mandated solar PV on new residences up to three stories starting 2020.On the other hand, California¡¦s residential solar water heater industry finds itself in a vicious cycle of low consumer demand and high prices. As the CSI-T report notes, \"In contrast to conventional gas and electric water heaters, which are typically installed by plumbers, solar water heaters are installed by a range of firms and public entities.\" In other words, consumers actively must seek out solar water heaters by relying on nonstandard sales channels.This additional friction reduces consumer demand among all but the most motivated consumers, leading to higher marketing costs that drive up the customer¡¦s bottom line. Prices in California are further exacerbated by past industry failures, which have led to strong, self-imposed regulations in the name of consumer satisfaction, says Murray. For example, after many cheaper solar water heating systems froze during the unprecedented 1990 freeze in California, only more expensive systems were allowed through the CSI-T program.All told, the cost of the average solar water heater sold in California through the CSI-T program was 7,400, compared to less than 1,000 for a fossil fuel alternative. By contrast, a solar water heater in Israel can cost as little as 700.Today, drumming up excitement for solar thermal remains difficult. According to CSI-T report interviews with solar water heater adopters, \"Some interviewees remarked that it seemed tough to get others interested, theorizing that PV was so dominant in neighbors¡¦ minds that solar water heating hardly registered.\"\"It¡¦s just the sizzling, sexy PV that really captivates the audience,\" says Murray.Entrepreneurs routinely caution, \"Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.\" In this case, the problem is carbon emissions, and, against entrepreneurial advice, individual governments have tended to fall in love with just one solution. For Israel, Cyprus, Hawaii and others, solar water heaters were that solution. For California, it¡¦s solar PV.By committing to a specific technology, governments fall prey to a conceptual error that science journalist Ed Yong recently referred to as a \"monogamy of solutions.\" (Interestingly, he argues this fallacy also shapes the government¡¦s response to COVID-19.) Rather than embracing the growing portfolio of technologies available to solve the carbon emissions problem, going all-in on one satisfies the very human need for \"magic bullets.\"Europe¡¦s Green Deal may model such a \"portfolio\" approach for the rest of the world, according to B?rbel Epp, a German physicist-turned-journalist with nearly two decades of experience studying the global solar thermal market.According to Epp, representatives from the European solar thermal market have lobbied the European Commission for over a decade to use solar thermal technologies to decarbonize the heating sector. \"It took the solar thermal industry I don¡¦t know how many years, at least 10, of just continuously repeating the sentence that heat is 50 percent of our final energy consumption in Europe. ¡K It was hard to lobby in Europe, but it¡¦s now obvious that we have to do something for heat.\" Whether these efforts will succeed in providing solar thermal a seat at the table remains to be seen.To Grossman, solar water heaters are the first piece of Israel¡¦s portfolio. As Israel struggles to meet its Paris Agreement goals, Grossman says he believes solar PV panels will take their place alongside solar water heaters on Israel¡¦s rooftops.Back in Sacramento, Murray is still battling for solar thermal. This year, he¡¦s lobbied the California legislature to extend the state¡¦s recently expired solar thermal subsidy program for one more year, citing COVID-19 as a barrier. The legislature hasn¡¦t budged, but Murray vows he¡¦ll keep going. He may be a lot older than he was in 1978, but the idealism is still alive.',\n",

Thanks in part to that surge, this year¡¦s issuance is on track to surpass 2019¡¦s record 257.7 billion of issuance.But the speed at which investors, corporate issuers and underwriters are aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the impact this will have on the overall sustainable bond market will be 2020¡¦s larger story.

That makes sense because the ultimate impact of most green bonds is a reduction in carbon emissions, said Marilyn Ceci, global head of ESG debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase.According to Steven Nichols, head of ESG capital markets for the Americas at BofA Securities, the surge in corporate ESG issuance is reflective of the increased buy- and sell-side focus on and awareness of ESG issues.Amid that heightened focus, trustees of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, set up to develop a single set of globally accepted accounting standards, are seeking input on the need for global sustainability standards and the role that the foundation could play a role in the development of such standards.\"There is urgent demand for consistency and comparability in sustainability reporting, especially for climate-related information,\" the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) said in its 2020 status report released last week.?And last Thursday, the New York State Department of Financial Services, which recently joined the NFGS, sent out a letter saying it expects state-regulated financial institutions to start developing approaches to climate-related financial risk disclosure; it suggested engaging with the TCFD¡¦s disclosure recommendations or other similar initiatives. It also said that it expects the financial institutions that it regulates to incorporate climate change-related financial risk into their internal governance frameworks, risk management processes and business strategies.According to the report, investor demand for companies to report information in line with TCFD recommendations has been growing dramatically. Additionally, central banks and supervisors ¡X through the Network for Greening the Financial System ¡X have encouraged companies issuing public debt or equity to disclose in line with the TCFD recommendations, the report noted.?September¡¦s green bond issuance surge was aided by low interest rates, issuers returning to market after several COVID-related quiet months?and a desire to issue before U.S. election-related volatility comes into play, but Germany and Sweden¡¦s inaugural green bond transactions gave the market its biggest boost. Germany¡¦s Triple-A rated, 10-year 7.59 billion sovereign green bond alone represented half of September¡¦s issuance.On arrival, Germany¡¦s issuance became the largest green bond issuance this year. And in a bid to increase transparency in the green bond market, when Germany¡¦s Federal Ministry of Finance issued its first green bond, it also issued a conventional bond that had the same coupon and maturity.\"Before that there seemed to be a pricing advantage for green bonds, but it was hard to identify outside of the secondary market because you never had an issuer doing two transactions at the same time,\" said Andrew Karp, head of global investment-grade capital markets at BofA Securities.The fact that Germany¡¦s green bond is?trading a couple of basis points tighter than its conventional bond twin indicates strong investor appetite. For corporate issuers, it also signals a potential cost benefit to issuing green debt.Despite the absence of a favorable regulatory environment, U.S. corporate issuance represents a sizeable portion of the green bond market. If the Biden/Harris presidential ticket ¡X which is campaigning on rejoining the Paris Agreement ¡X wins, U.S. corporate green bond issuance likely will grow at a faster clip. \"But the rules of the market will likely be set in the EU and Beijing,\" Robins said.The European Commission is expected to introduce its Green Bond Standard next year, and disclosures against the EU taxonomy or sustainable activities also will start to become mandatory for EU investors and corporates in 2021. The EU¡¦s taxonomy regulation involves establishing the criteria for determining whether an activity qualifies as \"sustainable.\"China, meanwhile, recently has proposed changing its green bond standards so that they more closely align with international ones. This could boost international investors¡¦ interest in its green bonds, Robins said.The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the depth of the world¡¦s interconnectedness. \"The pandemic has also demonstrated that the wallet and the will is available to react to an acute situation,\" said Ketish Pothalingam, executive vice president and portfolio manager at PIMCO.\"In many respects climate change is far more threatening to our longer-term outcomes than the pandemic is,\" he added, underscoring that he does not want to downplay the impact of the pandemic.?As part of its COVID-19 recovery package, the EU plans to sell 263 billion of green bonds and 117 billion of social bonds.According to Matthew Kuchtyak, assistant vice president on Moody\\'s Investors Service¡¦s ESG team, the EU¡¦s plans to issue up to 117 billion of social bonds would nearly double the total size of the social bond market globally, demonstrating that the European market is at the forefront of sustainable finance developments.In mid-October, the EU launched a two-tranche 19.85 billion inaugural social bond under SURE, a COVID relief program designed to protect jobs and keep people in work. The bond, which included a 10-year 11.7 billion issuance and a 20-year 8.17 billion issuance, was more than 13 times oversubscribed.Some market participants say Europe¡¦s sovereign green and social bond issuances should help with standardization around impact reports and key performance indicators (KPIs). Others added they think these issuances will help establish euro-denominated green and social yield curves, which can provide corporates with a comparative pricing for conventional bonds versus green bonds. \"Credibility comes from standardization,\" Thallinger said.In the coming months, JPMorgan and BoA Securities both expect to see continued thematic growth in social bonds, sustainability bonds and sustainability-linked bonds and increased investor attention to ESG-related supply chain issues.\"Supply chains and their sustainable procurement is an important issue for investors. . Corporates are in the driver¡¦s seat and can demand that their supply chains deliver certified sourced goods,\" JPMorgan¡¦s Ceci added.Whereas sustainability bonds proceeds can be used to finance a combination of green and social projects, sustainability-linked bonds are linked to KPIs and their coupons are dependent on whether a reference ESG target ¡X or a set of ESG targets ¡X is met.Because sustainability-linked bonds are holistic in nature, they can also address the \"G\" in ESG, said Nicholas Pfaff, head of sustainable finance at the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).By trying to lower emissions at the firm level, sustainability-linked bonds tackle some?issues identified in a recent Bank for International Settlements¡¦ report that explored the case for a firm-wide rating based on carbon intensity (emissions relative to revenue) as a way to reduce corporate carbon emissions.According to Robins, sustainability-linked bonds can pack a bigger punch than a firm-level rating based on carbon intensity. \"Because they can connect green and social outcomes with the cost of capital, generating financial incentives for delivery,\" he explained.Ultimately, heavy emitters, largely absent from the green bond market, need a pathway to issue green bonds so that they can finance a transition to a low-carbon economy, said Heather Lang, executive director of sustainable finance solutions at Sustainalytics. \"It is time to broaden the tent,\" she added, noting sustainable bond markets offer an opportunity for capital markets to assist heavy emitters as they transition to lower emissions compatible with overarching climate goals.In a whitepaper released in September, the Climate Bonds Initiative and Credit Suisse explored what financing a credible brown to green transition could entail. ICMA plans to release a climate transition finance handbook by year end.',\n",
              " '\"We¡¦ve been pressing the snooze button for 30 years,\" said Johan Rockstr?m, a co-developer of the planetary boundaries framework, last week during the TED Countdown Summit about the human response to climate change. He reminded the audience that the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the sixth report from the 195-member body.\"We¡¦re not sleepwalking towards a cliff. We¡¦re sleepwalking in a minefield,\" Rockstr?m continued, after discussing the Earth¡¦s climate tipping points. \"We¡¦re at risk of pressing buttons at every step we take.\"Disclosure: My transportation and boarding during the TED Countdown event was paid for by philanthropic donations to TED.Later on the TED Countdown stage, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore painted the dire picture of the current state of the climate emergency. He pointed to Hurricane Ida¡¦s destruction, 2020¡¦s record temperatures, sea-level rise, the long-lasting drought in the Western U.S. (and other parts of the world, where drought has led to food insecurity) and increasing wildfires around the world.\"We can¡¦t let these conditions become the new normal,\" Gore said. \"It¡¦s not fine. And this is an example of why it¡¦s not fine ¡X a lightning strike hitting a gas leak in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.\"Gore also noted predictions regarding the millions, if not billions of people who will migrate because of climate change ¡X individuals who have become or will become climate refugees.\"If we continue over the next few decades, uninhabitable areas are predicted to expand, and billions of people will be in areas where it is not safe to stay outside for more than a couple of hours,\" he said. The United Nations estimates that 1 billion people could be climate refugees by 2050.At this point, the impacts of climate change have already arrived, and people¡¦s lives have already been changed by them. But how can governments and corporations respond in a way that can mitigate the future impacts of the climate crisis?Here are two big ideas from TED speakers that answer the question.Oil and gas companies are continuing to do their legacy work, and the end of it is not in sight. As noted last week, Shell has shared a strategy to become a net-zero company by 2050, but it¡¦s still producing oil and gas because \"the world still uses oil and gas.\"While on stage, Gore noted that only about 4 percent of investments from oil and gas companies are going towards renewables. \"And they¡¦re telling a different story to Wall Street,\" he said.The story that they¡¦re telling Wall Street is related to their increased investment in plastics.During her talk, Canadian climate campaigner Tzeporah Berman ¡X international program director at Stand.Earth and chair of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative ¡X noted that governments are regulating emissions but not the production of fossil fuels. And that¡¦s a problem.\"I will never forget the day that I sat with the Paris Agreement and I searched for the words fossil fuels, oil, gas, coal,\" Berman said. \"They didn¡¦t appear, not even once, in the world¡¦s climate agreement.\"Berman noted that if the world were to stop expansion today, it has more than enough fossil fuels in existing projects to use while managing a phase-down of their use.\"It¡¦s not a transition if we¡¦re still growing the problem,\" Berman said.So, how do we stop growing the problem? Enter the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global initiative to phase out fossil fuels and support a just transition that has received endorsements from city governments ¡X Los Angeles, Sydney and Barcelona, to name a few ¡X climate NGOs and individuals including more than 2,500 scientists, academics and researchers.?\"Some of the criticism that we get is that it¡¦s too big, it¡¦s unfeasible, it¡¦ll take too long,\" Berman said. \"For me, the answer is, ¡¥We don¡¦t have time for more of the same.¡¦\"\"We think about saving the ocean from plastic, oil and oil spills, or from fishing,\" said Susan Ruffo, senior advisor for Ocean and Climate at United Nations Foundation. \"We should be thinking about how the ocean is saving us.\"The ocean is already saving us from the climate change that we¡¦re creating, by being the world¡¦s largest carbon sink ¡X it currently absorbs almost one-third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. So how can this huge body of water further help us in addressing climate change impacts?First, humans have to take care of it to make sure it still functions properly. There¡¦s already evidence that the ocean is warming and acidifying. And sea-level rise is already a reality.Ruffo pointed to mangroves, which can sequester between four and 10 times as much carbon as terrestrial forests, and oyster reefs as solutions that can protect against coastal storms.\"In this new climate reality that we¡¦ve created, we will have to learn how to live with water and with the ocean in new ways,\" Ruffo said. And the ocean could have more solutions to offer.The ocean is a complex system that takes up 70 percent of the planet but we¡¦re just beginning to understand it. For perspective, just 20 percent of the ocean floor has been mapped.\"There¡¦s so much more out there that we could be doing and thinking about as climate solutions and so much that we¡¦re still getting our imaginations around,\" Ruffo said.',\n",

In 2014, the electrical engineer and MBA became the first woman to lead a U.S. automaker.As electric vehicles drive toward the mainstream, General Motors has come full circle as well. It mass-produced the first electric car in the 1990s, then literally crushed most of them in 2003. Now, in its eventual internal-combustion phaseout, GM can¡¦t seem to make EVs fast enough, and 30 new models are lined up for the market for 2025. In November, the company said it will spend 7 billion more than initially planned on electric and self-driving vehicles through 2025, a total of 27 billion.Barra\\'s vision for General Motors includes bringing emissions, crashes and congestion down to zero while becoming the \"most inclusive company in the world.\" The automaker¡¦s sustainability goals include sourcing energy only from renewable sources and getting at least half the materials in its vehicles from recycled, bio-based or renewable origins ¡X by 2030 in the U.S. and globally by 2040.The company touts advancing responsibility for sourcing raw ingredients, such as cobalt, within its supply chain. Nearby in Flint, where at least 100,000 residents suffered exposure?to lead-poisoned tap water, GM turned millions of water bottles into filler for coats for homeless people.To prevent additional layoffs as the pandemic dented sales, Barra took a temporary pay cut, and GM pivoted with partners to build ventilators and masks. Less advertised around that time, the company unveiled details about its new modular vehicle platform and Ultium batteries, designed to lower EV prices and allow a 400-mile range fully charged.LinkedIn | Company profileChristophe Beck is brand-new as Ecolab CEO this month, taking over from retiring Doug Baker, an established advocate of the \"virtuous cycles\" of sustainability and profitability. In Beck¡¦s mind, too, forwarding-thinking companies should look at natural resources not just as consumables but as recyclable goods, and then design systems and products in a way that eliminates waste.Nearly a century ago, Ecolab sold dishwasher soap with a dispenser described as its first effort to reduce waste. The next frontier is \"connected chemistry,\" extending the internet of things to \"the internet of natural resources,\" Beck said in 2019.The leader in water, hygiene and energy services sells to a diverse collection of institutions such as hospitals, food and beverage providers, as well as heavy industry including power plants and plastic manufacturers. Ecolab says it helped its customers save enough water in 2018 equivalent to the needs of 600 million people. The company, an early partner with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, has positioned water and carbon emissions as equally critical in the climate crisis. Last year, Ecolab set a goal for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, getting halfway there by 2030.Beck, trained in mechanical engineering and aerodynamics, worked at one time for the European Space Agency. Spending the past year as Ecolab¡¦s president and COO, he joined as an executive vice president in 2008 after capping off 15 years as Nestl?¡¦s head of corporate sales in Europe.Company profileRosalind Brewer is the first African-American and woman to steer the company¡¦s Americas operations as well its global supply chain, product and store development. Yet about six months in as president and COO at Starbucks, she was terrified in 2018 to hear that two Black men had been arrested needlessly at one of its Philadelphia stores.\"This could happen to my son any day of the week,\" she said. \"I felt like it happened under my watch.\"Starbucks ramped up its anti-bias training, closing 8,000 stores one day to do so ¡X a prelude in 2018 to its response to the interconnected crises of 2020. In October, Starbucks announced it would ramp up hiring of people of color to at least 30 percent of the corporate workforce and 40 percent of retail and manufacturing by 2025. It¡¦s also investing in professional mentorship for minorities and backing communities through 6.5 million in Neighborhood Grants.A chemist with a knack for analytics, Brewer has spoken of bringing her head and her heart to leadership. She was known for promoting diversity and inclusion while CEO and president of Walmart Sam¡¦s Club.At Starbucks, that expanded focus also blends with its climate leadership initiatives. In 2019, it issued a 1 billion sustainability bond, the first corporation to do so. After learning of the outsize impact of dairy in its supply chain, it added more plant-based items to its menu.\"I can¡¦t even explain to you how much richer the conversations are when you have a diverse group of people in the room challenged against one problem, and how quickly you get to solutions,\" she said in 2018.No doubt those conversations will be at play in Starbucks¡¦ 50th year.

Their next big project, payment service provider Stripe, has ballooned in its 10th year to a 36 billion valuation, just behind Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX among a few privately held unicorns.CEO Collison (John is president) has his eye on making an outsized climate impact by accelerating negative-carbon solutions. In May, Stripe named four young CO2-sequestration efforts it¡¦s bankrolling with a combined 1 million, including Project Vestas (green-rock beaches) and CarbonCure (concrete). Natural carbon sinks, carbon mineralization and direct-air capture are early focus areas for Stripe¡¦s 2019 Negative Emissions Commitment, which aims to spend at least double in these areas compared with what it pays for carbon offsets.Stripe Climate, launched in October, is an attempt to address a chicken-egg problem by driving up adoption for CO2-removal services that are, for now, prohibitively expensive for other companies. Online merchants can divert a portion of each sale toward carbon sequestration, and show that off to downstream shoppers at the point of purchase. Unlike with offsets, there¡¦s no tit-for-tat estimate of how many GHG tons may be involved, which is intentional.The billionaire bibliophile has a side publishing effort, Stripe Press, which tries to further \"ideas that we think can be broadly useful\" toward shaping \"the world of tomorrow.\"LinkedIn | Company profileFrom its cosmetics direct-sales origins in 1969, Natura &Co has matured to swallow up Avon, the Body Shop and Aesop. The Brazilian company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange one year ago, sells beauty and biodiversity as intertwined. Its mission: to offer products that \"promote the harmonious relationship of the individual with oneself, with others and with nature.\"Working under group CEO Roberto Marquez, Jo?o Paulo Ferreira¡¦s Latin America CEO position has overseen the heart of the original business since 2016. The electronic engineer and MBA spent 19 years as a supply chain vice president at Unilever before joining Natura in 2009.In 2019, Ferreira urged Brazilian leaders to protect the fire-scarred Amazon rainforest, from which so much megadiversity ¡X and Natura¡¦s product base ¡X derives. Ucuuba berries used in a moisturizer, for example, are more lucrative for local residents to collect and sell to Natura than chopping down the trees for timber.\"But you have to do this in an orderly way that conserves the local culture, including traditional know-how, and adds value to the communities involved,\" Ferreira has said.In the past decade, Natura has planted several hundred million dollars toward rainforest protection and sustainable development. Full traceability for palm oil, mica, paper, alcohol, soy and cotton is due in 2025. The company¡¦s \"Commitment to Life\" vision for 2030 includes net-zero GHG emissions by 2030, and raising by 7.4 million acres the 4.4 million acres it protects in the Amazon.Natura, which issues a regular environmental profit-and-loss statement, went carbon-neutral in 2007 and became the first public B Corporation in 2014.Furthering fair wages and closing the gender gap is another goal, as is embracing circular principles.

Farmers are \"the original environmentalists,\" she said in July. \"The way we think about sustainability is data-enhanced decisions.\"Land O¡¦Lakes is a cooperative owned by some 300,000 farmers, who were already struggling before COVID-19 upended supply chains. Toward its bid to accelerate regenerative agriculture and aid farmers, one acre and data point at a time, the company recently partnered with Microsoft on a multi-year effort to hasten innovation and boost rural broadband. Microsoft¡¦s cloud architecture eventually will house Land O¡¦Lakes¡¦ data tools including Truterra, which tracks impacts on soil, air and water from no-till, cover crops and fertilizer management practices, as well as WinField United r7 software that uses satellite imagery and geolocated data.Raised in Iowa, Ford became the only openly gay Fortune 500 CEO in 2018. She came to the co-op from International Flavors & Fragrances in 2012 as supply chain and operations executive vice president and became COO several years later.

Ford is on the board of directors at the Business Roundtable, Consumer Goods Forum and U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.LinkedInLogan Green has cited growing up with Southern California traffic and carpooling as a student in Zimbabwe for inspiring the launch of Zimride in 2007. He was fresh out of a business economics bachelor¡¦s program in Santa Barbara and a stint as the youngest director on the local Metro Transit District board.Zimride merged into Lyft in 2013, its vehicles announced by a fuzzy pink \"grill-stache.\" By 2019, the company counted more than a billion total rides, with 2 million annual drivers in more than 650 U.S. and Canadian cities.In June, Lyft set a course to move toward 100 percent electric or other emission-free vehicles by 2030. That¡¦s in the vehicles that Lyft drivers own, as well as the company¡¦s Express Drive rentals for drivers and its eventual Level 5 self-driving fleets.The ride-sharing brand positions this as a radical shift that will benefit communities, partly by reducing pollution. Working with the Environmental Defense Fund, Lyft predicts it will prevent the release of tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions and avert the consumption of a billion tons of gasoline.Lyft¡¦s IPO filing in 2019 exposed contradictions between its goals to \"redesign our cities around people, not cars,\" and the traffic congestion its rides have caused. Among other challenges, Lyft¡¦s scooter rentals mostly have flopped, but the company isn¡¦t giving up on micromobility. And its LyftUp effort seeks to meet transportation needs in underserved urban communities.Ridesharing demand crashed with COVID-19, and Lyft became part of the frontline delivery and medical access infrastructure. With holes in the gig economy torn open, Lyft tried to keep some drivers working by partnering with Amazon, and paid some time off due to virus exposure. Although they laid off nearly 1,000 employees, Green and co-founder John Zimmer declined their own pay.The company has played the self-described \"woke\" foil to market leader Uber. \"We care\" is what sets Lyft apart, Green has said. Lyft¡¦s first ESG report reaffirmed as much in July, also showing that working conditions for its diverse driver base top the list of stakeholder concerns, alongside community safety and emissions.LinkedIn | Company profileAfter the contentious exit of David Crane, who was leaning hard into the disruptive power of renewables, COO Gutierrez became CEO overnight in 2015. The company has since whipsawed between its wholesale-energy legacy of fossil fuels and greener horizons. To mollify shareholders, NRG shed its renewables business and EVGo vehicle-charging infrastructure.However, like Crane before him, Gutierrez is wise to the macro trends that favor clean energy, and has called sustainability \"the glue that keeps all of our stakeholders working together toward a common goal with purpose.\" In 2019, Gutierrez issued a new goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, expecting to reach it halfway by 2025.NRG in December issued a 900 million sustainability-linked bond, which it called a first for a North American company.Motivated to decarbonize, digitize and customize, Gutierrez has been advancing an integrated-power strategy to bring generation and retail together. Rather than invest capital directly in renewable-energy projects, he wants NRG to provide long-term contracts that improve their financeability.Gutierrez joined NRG from Dynegy in 2004 as an energy portfolio director. The engineer holds master¡¦s degrees in mineral economics and petroleum economics.An outspoken advocate for racial justice, Gutierrez has urged companies to take action on social issues that matter to stakeholders, and to be honest that the playing field is not level. \"We cannot create equity value if we do not take care of our employees or if we don¡¦t serve our customers and their communities,\" he said in June.LinkedIn | Company profileHelena Helmersson may be the first former CSO to ascend to the top job at a major corporation, signaling H&M¡¦s designs to further stitch sustainability and equity into operations.

A vocal advocate for purpose in retail, she oversees 126,000 employees and 5,000 storefronts in 74 countries, with a complex supply chain network.The H&M model embodies some big contradictions. It helped define fast fashion, yet is in the vanguard of circular innovations in apparel. It strives to improve conditions for garment workers and improve transparency, yet still attracts activist ire.H&M seeks by 2030 to become fully circular, eliminating waste and adopting sustainable and recycled materials, and has partnered with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation since 2018. Helmersson views engaging consumers as the key, and the company is working on the Higg Index with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to improve industry labeling.H&M is among the first apparel giants to enable product take-back for any garment and to prioritize reducing toxic chemicals in manufacturing. In 2019, customers returned 29,000 tonnes of worn clothes in exchange for 15 percent discounts, beating company expectations.Pure cotton and polyester can be downcycled into insulation and other things. H&M forged a five-year partnership in November with RenewCell to produce millions of pieces of clothing from Circulose, a pulp made from used cotton fabric. The H&M Foundation and CO:LAB venture capital arm share a focus on advancing textile recycling.More broadly, the company is moving toward a \"climate positive\" value chain by 2040, embracing science-based targets.

A subsidiary is involved in an early-stage, gene-based vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\"We all have to speak up in defense of really rigorous, well-defined science,\" Narasimhan said in December. \"If we lose that battle, the world will give up a lot of the gains that we¡¦ve had and perhaps many we could have in areas like environment and climate change.\"With erudite Narasimhan in charge, Novartis is buckling down to embed ESG into operations. In September, the company issued healthcare¡¦s first sustainability bond, priced at 2.26 billion. In November it became the first European pharmaceutical company to meet 100 percent renewables through virtual power purchase agreements. The Swiss firm aims to reach neutrality in carbon, water and plastic by 2030 across its supply chain, and phase out polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in medical packaging by 2025.The charismatic \"unboss,\" as he has called his role, has been at Novartis since 2007, with a stint at Sandoz. Raised in Pittsburgh and one of the youngest multinational leaders, Narasimhan is fond of sharing books that inspire him on Twitter. He serves on the National Academy of Medicine and on boards including African Parks.LinkedIn | Company profilePatti Poppe has a grounded, straight-talking style, an inclination to see opportunities in crisis, and an embrace of innovation to enrich the triple bottom line. It¡¦s easy to see why Pacific Gas & Electric snapped her up in November from Consumers Energy in Michigan, where she was on track to fold its coal and nuclear operations by 2040.\"There are ways to make this clean energy transition that are additive, that are extraordinary,\" she said in 2019. \"We¡¦ve got work to do; there¡¦s no time to stand on the sidelines and hope and holler and think that somebody¡¦s gonna do something about this.\"As the California utility crawls out of a bankruptcy and restructuring, the human and environmental toll left by the epic wildfires it caused remain incalculable. Can PG&E earn back the trust of its 16 million consumers? A clue may be found in Poppe¡¦s approach to a crisis. Rather than asking if something is possible, she advocates for asking, \"What has to be true to bring it to fruition?\"Consumers Energy CEO since 2016, she was praised for preventing a bigger emergency two subzero Januarys ago, after a fire at a natural gas compressor threatened energy transmission. The company texted residents to turn down their thermostats, they responded, and nobody lost heat.As for the slower-moving climate crisis, Poppe grabbed the opportunity of a generation to replace fossil fuels and phase in \"modular\" renewables. The industrial engineer even made energy efficiency enticing at Consumers, in May teaming up with Google to give away Nest smart thermostats to 100,000 customers.Poppe said she won¡¦t abandon her coworkers or their communities during the energy transition, describing how career employees at a shuttered coal plant stayed at the company. Before working in energy, the Michigander spent 15 years in plant management at General Motors. She¡¦s the first woman to move from one Fortune 500 CEO office to another.LinkedIn | Company profileOne million Clorox wipes, prized during the pandemic, were rolling off the company¡¦s assembly lines each day in 2020. The company cleaned up in sales, and it¡¦s going on an advertising offense.It¡¦s up to new CEO Linda Rendle how aggressively Clorox will lead its 8,800 employees on sustainability. Joining the America Is All In pledge supporting the Paris Agreement in December is an early indicator. One of Rendle¡¦s tasks for 2021 will be to complete a 100 percent renewable electricity goal for Clorox¡¦s U.S. and Canadian operations.Rendle is the first woman in the job as of September, and the 38th female CEO on the Fortune 500. Promoted from president, she has risen steadily over 18 years through a series of vice president titles in supply chain and operations. Rendle has shunned social media. Visa cited her strategy- and brand-building experience when it welcomed her to its board in November.In August, the 98-year-old company joined the U.S. Plastics Pact, and it aligned in 2019 with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation¡¦s New Plastic Economy commitment. Clorox seeks to prevent plastic waste and pollution in packaging, pledging to halve its use of virgin plastic and fiber by 2030 while doubling PCR recycled plastic. By 2025, it wants to achieve 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging. (None of that addresses closing the loop on the synthetic wipes themselves.)The bleach and Brita filter maker is also phasing out PVC and supporting emerging refill models. Its recyclable Glad food bags and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing are available through the innovative Loop reusable packaging service. Clorox reportedly seeks to build on its legacy of \"natural\" products, burnished when it bought Burt¡¦s Bees in 2008, and in its own formulation of the Green Works line of household cleaners.LinkedIn | Company profileAs CEO since 2015, Chuck Robbins has earned accolades for taking Cisco¡¦s corporate responsibility to new heights while keeping the enterprise hardware brand nimble in the cloud computing era. In 2016, he issued an edict to positively affect 1 billion people by 2025. Last year, he set a new corporate purpose: \"To power an inclusive future for all.\"The company and its foundation have pledged more than half a billion dollars toward coronavirus relief. Cisco pledged 50 million in 2018 to address Silicon Valley homelessness and sponsors numerous programs and competitions to bridge digital divides and reward planet-positive technology innovations.Because Cisco¡¦s technologies underpin many of the world¡¦s \"webscale\" data centers, its advances enable a more energy-efficient, less emissions-intense internet. Its efficient 1 billion Silicon One architecture, for instance, squeezes more bandwidth out of routers.Since 2007, Cisco has reduced its GHG emissions by 55 percent since 2007. It has almost reached the goals for 2022 of 85 percent renewable electricity globally and 87 percent energy efficiency for its rack-mounted hardware.Robbins, who joined the company in 1997, also has led a top-down shift calling on the 75,000 employees to embrace circular principles such as modular designs in all products by 2025, building on Cisco¡¦s seasoned product takeback and remanufacturing programs.He serves on the board of Ford Foundation, is a Business Roundtable member and has called himself \"the ultimate optimist.\"\"OK, how is it that a kid who lived on a dirt road in Georgia has become CEO of a major tech company?\" he said in 2019. \"And I just realized that we have to run a good business, but there¡¦s more to it.

Working with farmers supports the company¡¦s goals to eliminate its environmental impact and slash emissions in half by 2030, reaching net-zero by 2050.\"This is a time when people increasingly look towards business as a force for good and making something happen, so this is our part and we are fully committed to playing that part,\" Schneider said in September.As for closing the loop, Schneider is leading Nestl? toward 100-percent recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025. The CPG giant in 2019 created its Institute of Packaging Sciences and joined the New Plastics Economy as a core partner. Nestl? last year released Nespresso pods with 80 percent recycled aluminum.The bottled water seller knows that whether an item actually gets recycled is at the mercy of regional infrastructure, so it¡¦s funding efforts to improve recycling technologies for vexing materials such as films, bags and bubble wrap, including a pilot effort with a curbside-pickup recycling plant in Pennsylvania.Here too, Schneider seeks to nurture an early market, buying 2 million metric tons of food-grade recycled plastics at a premium of close to 2 billion.LinkedIn | Company profileLong an influencer in style and sustainability, Levi Strauss pioneered low-water techniques to finish and weather jeans, and its Screened Chemistry program led to removing hazardous chemicals from its supply chain.

              " 'With record high unemployment, a reeling global economy and concerns of food shortages, the world as we know it is changing. But even as these shifts expose inequities in the health and food systems, many experts hope that the current moment offers an opportunity to build a new, more sustainable food system.To understand what it will take to move forward, Food Tank has compiled its summer reading list to delve into the issues that affect our food system today. These 20 books provide insight into food access and justice in Black communities, food relief and school nutrition programs, the effects of technology on global food supply chains, the relationship between climate change and food production, and much more.1. \"Be My Guest: Reflections on Food, Community, and the Meaning of Generosity\" by Priya Basil (forthcoming November)Priya Basil explores the meaning of hospitality within a variety of cultural, linguistic and sociopolitical contexts in this short read. Basil uses her cross-cultural experience to illustrate how food amplifies discourse within families and touches on the hospitality and the lack thereof that migrants and refugees experience. \"Be My Guest\" is at once an enjoyable read and a hopeful meditation on how food and hospitality can make a positive difference in our world.2. \"Biodiversity, Food and Nutrition: A New Agenda for Sustainable Food Systems\" by Danny Hunter, Teresa Borelli and Eliot GeeLeading professionals from Bioversity International examine the positive impacts of biodiversity on nutrition and sustainability. The book highlights agrobiodiversity initiatives in Brazil, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Turkey, featuring research from the Biodiversity for Food and Nutrition Project (BFN) of the?Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. Through this analysis, the authors propose that the localized activities in these countries not only are benefiting communities, but also are transferable to other regions.3. \"Black Food Geographies: Race, Self-Reliance, and Food Access in Washington, D.C.\" by Ashant? M. ReeseAshant? Reese draws on her fieldwork to highlight community agency in response to unequal food access. Focusing on a majority-Black neighborhood in Washington, D.C., Reese explores issues of racism, gentrification and urban food access. Through her analysis, she argues that racism affects and exacerbates issues of unequal food distribution systems.4. \"Black Food Matters: Racial Justice in the Wake of Food Justice\" edited by Hanna Garth and Ashant? M. Reese (forthcoming October)Access, equity, justice and privilege are the central themes in this forthcoming collection of essays. The food justice movement often ignores the voices of Black communities and white food norms shape the notions of healthy food. Named for Black Lives Matter, \"Black Food Matters\" highlights the history and impact of Black communities and their food cultures in the food justice movement.5. \"Diners, Dudes & Diets: How Gender and Power Collide in Food Media and Culture\" by Emily J.H. Contois (forthcoming November)Emily Contois looks at media¡¦s influence on eating habits and gendered perceptions of food. Focusing on the concept of dude foods, the book follows the evolution of food marketing for men. In doing so, Contois shows how industries used masculine stereotypes to sell diet and weight loss products to a new demographic. She argues that this has influenced both the way consumers think about food and their own identities.6. \"Feeding the Crisis: Care and Abandonment in America¡¦s Food Safety Net\" by Maggie DickinsonThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is essential for individuals who face food insecurity on a daily basis. Still, the program fails to reach many, including those who are unemployed, underemployed or undocumented. \"Feeding the Crisis\" provides a historical overview of SNAP¡¦s expansion and traces the lives of eight families who must navigate the changing landscape of welfare policy in the United States.7. \"Feeding the Other: Whiteness, Privilege, and Neoliberal Stigma in Food Pantries\" by Rebecca T. de SouzaRebecca de Souza explores the relationship between food pantries and people dependent on their services. Throughout the work, de Souza underscores the structural failures that contribute to hunger and poverty, the racial dynamics within pantries and the charged idea of a handout. She argues that while food pantries currently stigmatize clients, there is an opportunity to make them agents of food justice.8. \"Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato\"?by Rebecca EarleRebecca Earle tells the story of the potato and its journey from a relatively unknown crop to a staple in modern diets around the world. Earle¡¦s work highlights the importance of the potato during famines and war, and explains the politics behind consumers¡¦ embrace of this food. Interspersed throughout are potato recipes that any reader can try.9. \"Food in Cuba: The Pursuit of a Decent Meal\" by Hanna GarthHanna Garth looks at food security and food sovereignty in the context of Cuba¡¦s second largest city, Santiago de Cuba. Throughout the work, Garth defines a decent meal as one that is culturally appropriate and of high quality.

Chatelain traces their growth during the 20th century and their intersection with Black capitalists and the civil rights movement. This book highlights the dichotomy between fast food¡¦s negative impacts on Black communities and the potential economic and political opportunities that the businesses offered them.11. \"Honey And Venom: Confessions of an Urban Beekeeper\"?by Andrew Cot?Andrew Cot? provides a history of beekeeping while taking the reader through his own trajectory in the industry. A manager of over 100 beehives, Cot? raises colonies across New York City, on the rooftops of churches, schools and more. Cot?¡¦s passion for beekeeping comes through clearly as he narrates the challenges and rewards of his career.12.?\"Life on the Other Border: Farmworkers and Food Justice in Vermont\" by Teresa M. MaresAgriculture, immigration and Central American and Mexican farm workers may conjure ideas of the Mexico-U.S. border, but in \"Life on the Other Border,\" Teresa Mares gives a voice to those laboring much farther north. Mares introduces the readers to the Latinx immigrants who work in Vermont¡¦s dairy industry while they advocate for themselves and navigate life as undocumented workers. This is an inspiring read that touches on the intersection of food justice, immigration and labor policy.13. \"Meals Matter: A Radical Economics Through Gastronomy\" by Michael SymonsMichael Symons argues that economics used to be, in its essence, about feeding the world but has become fixated with the pursuit of money. Symons introduces readers to gastronomic liberalism and applies the ideas of philosophers such as Epicurus and John Locke to the food system. Through this approach, he seeks to understand how large corporations gained control of the market and challenges readers to rethink their understanding of food economics.14. \"No One is Too Small to Make a Difference\" by Greta ThunbergGreta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the 2019 U.N. Climate Action Summit and has become a global symbol of environmental activism. Her community organizing and impassioned speeches are uncompromising as she argues that climate change is an existential crisis that needs to be confronted immediately. \"No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference\" includes Thunberg¡¦s speeches and includes her 2019 address to the United Nations.15.?\"Perilous Bounty: The Looming Collapse of American Farming and How We Can Prevent It\" by Tom Philpott (forthcoming August)Journalist Tom Philpott critically analyzes the centralized food system in the United States and argues that it is headed for disaster unless it sees some much-needed changes. Philpott argues that actors within the U.S. food system are prioritizing themselves over the nation¡¦s well-being and provides well-researched data to back up his claims. Providing readers insight into the experiences of activists, farmers and scientists, this is a great read for those starting to learn about the state of the country¡¦s food system and for those who are already deeply involved.16. \"Plucked: Chicken, Antibiotics, And How Big Business Changed The Way The World Eats\" by Maryn McKennaIn this expos? on the chicken industry, acclaimed author Maryn McKenna explains the role antibiotics played in making chicken a global commodity. \"Plucked\" makes it clear that food choices matter and show how consumers¡¦ desire for meat, especially chicken, has affected human health. McKenna also offers a way forward and outlines ways that stakeholders can make food safer again.17. \"Stirrings: How Activist New Yorkers Ignited a Movement for Food Justice\" by Lana Dee PovitzBetween 1970 and 2000, food activists in New York City pushed to improve public school lunches, provide meals to those affected by the AIDS epidemic and establish food co-ops. In \"Stirrings,\" Lana Dee Povitz draws on oral histories and archives to recount the stories of individuals who led these efforts. She highlights the successes of grassroots movements and reminds readers of the many female leaders in the New York food justice movement.18. \"The New American Farmer: Immigration, Race, and the Struggle for Sustainability\" by Laura-Anne Minkoff-ZernLaura-Anne Minkoff-Zern offers a look at farm labor in the U.S. Although most farm owners are white Americans, farm workers are overwhelmingly immigrants and people of color. In this book, Minkoff-Zern details the experiences of farm laborers who are becoming farm owners themselves and outlines the many barriers that workers must overcome during this transition. Through interviews with farmers and organizers, Minkoff-Zern shows that these farmers bring sustainable agricultural practices that can benefit our food system.19. \"The Story of More: How We Got to Climate Change and Where to Go from Here\" by Hope JahrenHope Jahren breaks down climate change for readers in an accessible and data-driven book. \"The Story of More\" explains how greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of natural resources in developed nations exacerbate climate change and outlines the consequences of these actions. Although she argues that the planet is in danger, she also provides a variety of everyday actions, such as decreasing meat consumption, that consumers can take to make a difference.20. \"Vegetable Kingdom: The Abundant World of Vegan Recipes\" by Bryant TerryAuthor, chef and food justice activist Bryant Terry provides readers with over 100 recipes to create approachable and flavorful vegan dishes, without relying on meat alternatives.

Vegans and non-vegans alike will appreciate \"Vegetable Kingdom.\"Alonso Diaz also contributed to this article.',\n",
              " 'Presidential elections are anxious times for federal land agencies and the people they serve. The Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Service manage more than a quarter of the nation¡¦s land, which means that a new president literally can reshape the American landscape.Federal influence is particularly significant in the Western United States. Across the 11 states from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast, the federal government owns more than 45 percent of all land. In Alaska it owns over 60 percent.Voters have a striking choice this year. President Donald Trump entered office committed to the \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" His administration raced to reduce environmental planning and regulations and expand private development in pursuit of \"energy dominance.\"In contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden¡¦s campaign proposals for public lands remain fairly broad, but are largely consistent with the Obama administration¡¦s priorities. The most significant difference is Biden¡¦s pledge to end new fossil fuel leasing on public lands.How would each candidate fulfill these promises? As I explain in my new book, \"This Land Is My Land: Rebellion in the West,\" public lands are a microcosm of today¡¦s polarized American politics.On the right, mainstream conservatives and industrial corporations want reduced regulation and increased resource development, while a more militantly anti-federal element of the Republican Party demands an end to public land ownership altogether. On the left, mainstream Democrats want carefully regulated land management with increased margins of environmental protection, but a vocal progressive wing is demanding that the federal government keep its fossil fuels in the ground. These tensions raise questions about how far each candidate would go.Since Ronald Reagan ran 40 years ago as a self-proclaimed \"sagebrush rebel\" who supported turning control of public lands back to Western states, Republicans have coalesced around a set of common public land priorities. They include reducing federal regulation, limiting the scope of environmental reviews and increasing natural resource development.This approach has drawn support from natural resource industries, resource-dependent communities and a growing body of public interest law firms, think tanks, advocacy groups, foundations and political action committees. Their core libertarian conviction is that reducing government leads to prosperity.The Trump administration has championed these priorities through actions that include shrinking several national monuments to expand oil leasing; preparing to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil production; and narrowing environmental reviews of major federal actions. The full impact of these actions is hard to assess, as many face challenges in court, where the administration has fared poorly. But their theme is clear: Public lands are open for business.As part of this effort, the Trump administration moved the Bureau of Land Management¡¦s headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction, Colorado. The agency has struggled to staff the new building, which it shares with several oil and gas companies.A vocal element of the Republican Party challenges the federal government¡¦s authority to own and manage public lands at all. Some advocates have engaged in armed confrontations with federal authorities. Several Western states have enacted legislation over the past decade demanding that the federal government transfer ownership of public lands and mineral rights to them.Trump has catered to this extreme wing while stopping short of meeting its explicit demands. He signaled support by appointing conservative activist William Perry Pendley as the Bureau of Land Management¡¦s functional acting director in July 2019 ¡X?a step that a federal court in Montana recently ruled was illegal because it bypassed a confirmation hearing. Pendley was known for staunch opposition to public land ownership and years of litigation over public land management.The president also has pardoned controversial figures embraced by opponents of public land authority, including former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and two Oregon ranchers convicted of arson on federal property.Despite his administration¡¦s losses in court, I expect that if Trump is reelected he will continue down this path of deregulation, resource development and deference to conservative Western interests, with occasional gestures of support to more radical conservatives.Recent Democratic presidents, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, have championed federal environmental laws that guide public land management, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. Democratic administrations have emphasized scientific monitoring and regulatory oversight while still supporting energy development and other commercial resource uses of public lands.Biden¡¦s long environmental record and campaign pledges suggest that he will continue this approach. Biden has promised to reverse the Trump administration¡¦s deregulatory efforts, restore national monument boundaries and manage energy development on public lands in ways that promote wind and solar energy and gradually phase out fossil fuel development.But a Biden administration would face tensions within the Democratic Party as well. Progressives are calling for more dramatic action to slow climate change, including bans on hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production and on new oil, gas and coal leases on public lands. Biden has signaled strong support for this agenda, but insists that hydraulic fracturing and fossil fuel development will continue on existing leases.A Biden administration, then, likely would seek to restore Obama¡¦s public lands legacy and push beyond it with tighter limits on fossil fuel production.These sharply different visions can obscure the fact that there is substantial commitment to public lands, especially as places for hunting, fishing, camping and other recreational uses. This consensus was evident when Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act of 2020 in July with strong bipartisan support. With an eye on election polls, Trump bragged that signing the bill made him the greatest environmental president since George Washington.As I see it, this bill was popular because it did not address controversial questions such as regulation or energy development. Instead it provided billions of dollars for maintaining roads, trails, visitor centers and other public land infrastructure. It also guaranteed permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses money from federal fossil fuel royalties to protect valuable lands and waters from development.That pairing suggests that public land ownership and fossil fuel development will both be part of the next administration. But the election will determine how these resources will be managed, and who will have the most influence over this process.',\n",
              " 'We¡¦re female entrepreneurs and environmentalists. We¡¦ve spent decades promoting clean energy technologies. In this strangest of all years, as the death toll mounts from a disease caused by human incursions into once intact ecosystems, we¡¦re observing another death ¡X?the demise of fossil fuels.Is that possible? Consider this: In April, Royal Dutch Shell, one of the largest companies in the world, announced its intent to become a net-zero carbon company by 2050. When oil and gas companies say that they¡¦re getting out of oil and gas, shouldn¡¦t you?No doubt Shell is counting on some miracle like carbon capture to preserve its adherence to a century-old business model of selling oil. And who could blame it? For years, extracting the black gold from the ground, processing it, then selling gasoline, fuel oil, petrochemicals and other refined products has been one of the most profitable businesses in history.In 2008, Exxon made a record 40.6 billion. For years, seven of the top 10 companies on the Dow Jones Index were oil companies until 2016 when most fell out of the top 10, leaving only Exxon. Last year, no fossil company made the top 10 list.Exxon¡¦s 2018 revenues were half of what it made a decade earlier; in 2019, it was only 14.3 billion. That¡¦s still a lot of money, but running an oil business is capital-intensive: Exxon was borrowing to pay dividends before COVID-19. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reported that \"the world¡¦s largest publicly traded oil and gas companies shelled out a total of 71.2 billion in dividends and share buybacks last year, while generating only 61 billion in free cash flow.\"?Meanwhile, the coal and natural gas industries are also collapsing around us ¡X?a swift decline from the shale fracking boom. Fracking equipment sits idly in fields, and utilities shutter coal and natural gas power plants indefinitely.In April, the bubble popped, perhaps forever: Oil future prices hit negative 37 a barrel.?What happened?COVID-19 constricted commuting, and demand for refined oil products fell fast. Oil companies ran out of places to store the stuff. Tankers at anchor in the Houston Ship Channel started bumping into each other, but the oil kept flowing.?Why? It turns out it¡¦s not easy to stop.Capping a well, realistically, means writing it off. Wells are capital-intensive to drill in the first place, but they are also costly to reopen. The cost to buy an oil rig runs from 20 million to 1 billion. Renting one isn¡¦t cheap, either. In 2018, Transocean (yes, the folks who brought you the BP oil spill) charged Chevron 830 million (445,000 a day) for one rig for five years. We bet someone¡¦s now trying to renegotiate that contract.Hydraulic fracturing isn¡¦t any cheaper. Even before the coronavirus hit, the shale gas Ponzi scheme was falling apart as investors realized that the enormous sums that they were asked to continue pouring into the industry were never likely to return a profit. Prices to frack a new well vary widely, depending on whether you¡¦re drilling in West Texas or horizontally to frack under housing developments, varying from 40 to 90 a barrel. The costs multiply because fracked wells typically last less than a year. Even before COVID-19, traditional oil was lifting for 10 to 20 a barrel in Saudi Arabia, with a world average of 40. Fracking was not a viable industry even before oil went negative.?If this is the case, isn¡¦t it a breach of fiduciary responsibility to invest in oil and gas extraction? If these are your own funds, throw them away if you wish, but Bevis Longstreth, former Securities and Exchange commissioner forecasted back in 2018, \"It is entirely plausible, even predictable that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will come to be ruled negligence.\"This helps explain why more than 11 trillion have been divested from fossil ownership, even before the University of California announced that it was divesting its 80 billion portfolio.Surely the world runs on oil. This will just be a blip to what is an essential industry for humankind, won¡¦t it?No. It won¡¦t. We can see the end. When the Kentucky Coal Museum puts solar on its roof because it is cheaper than hooking up to the coal-fired grid at its doorstep, it¡¦s over.For fundamental economic reasons, solar power generation plus battery storage will provide at least half of electric power generation globally by 2030. Last summer, General Electric walked away from a natural gas plant in California that had a projected 20 years life because it can¡¦t compete with solar.And this trend is happening around the world.?India canceled 14 new proposed coal plants because they can¡¦t compete with solar. Portugal achieved 1.6 cents a kilowatt hour (?kWh) for utility-scale solar, a price almost five times below building a new coal or gas plant. This spring the government announced that the country was 100 percent renewably powered and canceled all subsidies for fossil energy. And then Abu Dhabi set the latest new record for \"everyday low price\" when it brought on utility scale solar at 1.3 ?kWh.In the bellwether state of California, the death knell for fossil fuels came when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power signed a deal to buy power from a utility-scale solar plus battery storage facility at 2.9?kWh. To put it simply, that is record-cheap solar power.While businesses, community organizations, utilities and government agencies move away from dependence on fossil-fueled power generation, you can make that same shift, too.You can have solar on your roof, a battery bank in your garage and be immune from power shutoffs, rising prices and vulnerability of all sorts. Centralized energy distribution from fossil fuels via the grid is not reliable (or cheaper). Extreme weather events are the biggest contributor to power outages and will increase with climate change, which the Department of Energy estimates costs the U.S. economy 150 billion annually. Customer-sited solar plus storage allows you to generate and store your own power, on or off-grid.Welcome to the triumph of the sun.',\n",

There is no place for unnecessary or non-recyclable packaging in our business.\"Tesco calculated banning plastic-wrapped multipacks from its shelves in early 2020 saved 67 million pieces of plastic alone, and it also expects its nationwide partnership with online shopping service Loop, which it launched last summer, to see an increasing share of the supermarket\\'s groceries delivered in reusable packaging.In August 2019, 1,500 Tesco suppliers were informed that packaging would form a key part of all future procurement decisions, with partners warned that products reliant on excessive packaging or hard-to-recycle materials would be at risk of being axed from Tesco supermarket shelves, it said.Paula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at conservation charity WWF, commended Tesco for its progress in tackling plastic waste and urged other firms to launch similar initiatives.\"Plastic pollution continues to be one of the most visible symptoms of the environmental crisis we\\'re currently facing,\" she said. \"Businesses, governments and households have all got an important part to play, so it\\'s encouraging to see Tesco delivering against their commitments to significantly reduce the amount of plastic we use.

We need green banks: an implementable, versatile answer for sustainable economic recovery.Many countries are on their way to making this solution a reality. Green banks are most often publicly owned, commercially operated, specialized financing institutions or facilities that act as focal points for scaling up domestic investment in climate-friendly, sustainable projects. The recently launched State of Green Banks 2020 report, the first comprehensive survey, aggregation and analysis of global green bank activity, found that a growing number of countries worldwide are exploring green banks.Twenty-seven green banks already exist in 12 countries and 25 more jurisdictions are actively exploring the model to implement nationally determined contributions, catalyze local green markets and create jobs. Existing green banks have shown an impressive track record to date, investing nearly 25 billion of their own capital since their respective inceptions and supporting projects with a total value of 70 billion as of mid-2020. More than 45 billion (or 64 percent) of this sum came from the private sector. Although existing green banks are predominantly situated in high-income countries, the green bank model is by no means limited to developed nations. Emerging green banks are in 25 countries across income levels and geographies around the world.However, survey respondents confirm that this budding ecosystem will need support to flourish. An overwhelming majority of emerging green banks indicated they will need support from multilateral and bilateral organizations for initial capital. Notable barriers to green bank establishment include lack of embedded technical expertise and difficulties in accessing outside technical assistance.An initiative dedicated to helping countries overcome these roadblocks, the Green Bank Design Platform, is under development. The Platform, a collaboration between the Green Finance Institute, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Rocky Mountain Institute, intends to help countries navigate the entire process and provide, coordinate or facilitate access to an array of services that target specific barriers to green bank establishment. These include providing knowledge products, securing funding and technical assistance for market assessments, assisting with capital recruitment and advising on institutional design.Deploying capital into local low-carbon and sustainable development solutions is paramount for ensuring sustainable COVID-19 recovery as well as for curbing emissions before 2050. For recovery, green banks can help channel and leverage fiscal resources to investments that provide near-term relief (such as through construction jobs) and long-term prosperity (by lowering energy costs and spurring new industries). For climate, Climate Policy Initiative estimates that between 1.6 trillion and 3.8 trillion will be required every year through 2050 for supply-side energy generation only ¡X compared to 546 billion actually deployed globally in 2018.Green banks can help to fill this gap as trusted local partners that attract new and varied pools of capital. By serving as focal points for climate finance within a country, they can tap into both domestic and international sources of capital: from pension and sovereign wealth funds to multilateral development banks and climate funds. In addition, green banks can flexibly address market gaps by deploying a wide range of financial instruments including guarantees, long-term debt, equity, subordinated debt and warehousing and securitization. Simultaneously, green bank investments in unproven technologies or underserved communities often serve as market demonstrators, thus removing barriers to green investment.Green banks are also an answer to a burning question in climate diplomacy: How can developing nations chart their own course to a zero-carbon future instead of relying on developed country funding? By centering climate finance in a domestic institution, green banks create a powerful vehicle for blending concessional support from sources such as the Green Climate Fund, non-concessional instruments from development finance institutions?and co-investment from the private sector.Importantly, green banks can be critical conduits for green recovery and job creation. By supporting the development of green sectors and attracting private investment into climate-resilient projects, green banks support the health of the broader economy. For example, the U.K. Green Investment Bank, founded in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, nearly tripled investment in U.K. green infrastructure within three years of establishment and made the U.K. the largest offshore wind market in the world within five years.Following on this success, the U.K. Chancellor recently announced the creation of the new National Infrastructure Bank (NIB). The role of the NIB will be to support the financing of the National Infrastructure Strategy, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stated reflects the U.K. Government¡¦s environmental agenda.In addition, a recently published report exploring the potential of a federal green bank in the United States found that it could create over 5 million new job-years within five years of establishment: over 3.3 million direct and 2.2 million indirect. In Mongolia, the Green Climate Fund approved funding for the Mongolia Green Finance Corporation in November. In India, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited executives report that renewable energy has been one of the most resilient sectors of the economy during the pandemic.Developed nations could help provide the needed support for global green bank development. Collaboratively, they could spur green bank establishment worldwide by directing development finance institutions, multilateral development banks and climate funds that they support to:We have in front of us an implementable, practical, proven solution that can drive forward answers to two major challenges we face: a post-COVID recession and climate change. In this critical moment and in the run-up to COP26, we must take leadership and act decisively to ensure a sustainable future; if we take action to support their growth, green banks can show us the way.',\n",
              " 'Sustainable packaging is a keystone issue for corporate sustainability. As one of the first environmental concerns companies began to tackle proactively, interest and efforts had notable resurgence in the last few years, partly spurred by the attention on ocean plastic. ?Then the pandemic hit, and the market changed ¡X characterized by higher demand for single-use packages and bags, and lower availability of recycled materials.When we look ahead, are we on the path to a circular and sustainable system for packaging?Shopping bags have long been a focus in sustainability ¡X from looking at greenhouse gas impacts (paper is higher) to litter (plastic has more challenges) and significant policy action. A shift away from a focus on single-use design emerged. Studies pointed out that bags that are effectively reused can be the best environmental option. ?Food service and consumer goods companies also were exploring this shift to durable packages for reuse. Over one-third of the participating product and packaging companies reported to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment that they are testing such options. While the pandemic impacted momentum for reusables in shopping bags and food services (for various reasons), it did not stop the growth of these solutions for consumer goods.Helping blaze the trail is TerraCycle¡¦s Loop program. Consumer brands partner with Loop to offer products in a durable package that when empty, get collected in various channels, cleaned and sanitized by Loop, and then refilled by the manufacturer for another use. Such commercially cleaned reusable packages or consumer refillable packages are poised for growth, given their two-pronged benefits of hygiene and sustainability.Reusable solutions are one path of a circular economy, but there is far more effort to advance another circular approach, recycling. Companies have more goals for designing for recycling and recovery, and increasing recycled content than other packaging issues.Designing recyclable packages begins with using recyclable materials. Colgate-Palmolive redesigned its toothpaste tube to be made of high density polyethylene (HDPE), instead of the traditional mix of plastics and metal that is not recyclable. Another design strategy is to avoid mixing materials. Paper cups usually have unrecyclable plastic coatings. Smart Planet Technologies developed a recyclable cup solution, and collaborative efforts such as the NextGen Cup Challenge likely will spur additional advances.Designing for recyclability, however, is not the silver bullet. Used packages need to be recycled. Recycling rates generally have been on the rise in the United States, adding up to about 50 percent of packaging and containers being recycled. However, that is largely comprised of paper and cardboard (75 percent of recycled packages). Only about 13 percent of plastic packages are recovered in the U.S. Adding to this, the pandemic led to a decrease in recycling. ?Companies are improving consumer communication about recycling, such as using the How2Recycle label. There is also investment in developing recycling infrastructure and collaborating on solutions for harder to recycle items ¡X such as The Recycling Partnership initiatives, the Materials Recovery for the Future initiative to increase film collection, the Hefty Energy Bag for chemical recycling, and the Closed Loop Partners funding expansion of recycling capability.To close the recycling loop, the recovered material needs to be used. While companies have committed to using it, fossil fuels prices were declining and then tanked during the pandemic, driving virgin plastic prices well below recovered plastic. The availability of recovered materials also decreased. Undoubtedly, companies will question their plans to increase recycled content in the current market. ?Companies relying on recycling as the way to effectively manage their packaging after use have a responsibility to support the end market for recovered material by continuing to use recycled content. There will be obstacles with price and availability, but they can be managed with measures such as investing in infrastructure development and design improvements (such as removing extra packaging material).Responsible fiber sourcing goals were among the first sustainable packaging targets, with many expiring in 2020. Loblaws met its target in 2018 by sourcing recycled or certified fiber. IKEA, Procter & Gamble and most other companies are on track to meet their 2020 targets. While progress has been made, sourcing fiber responsibly is still a gap for too many companies.The Consumer Goods Forum and others also see a need to take fiber sourcing to the next level, reaching beyond responsible sourcing for each company¡¦s supply chain to landscape-level approaches that reach additional suppliers within a region and support infrastructure and policies to get to a \"forest positive\" approach. ?Responsible sourcing also fits into climate strategies. With over 800 companies committed to setting science-based climate targets, impacts from packaging are being evaluated. Colgate Palmolive, General Mills and Walmart have included packaging improvement in their climate programs. In addition to sourcing, reducing packaging material use is effective. As this is a cost-savings opportunity, it has been a core approach in sustainable packaging. Since 2010, Procter & Gamble had a 13.5 percent reduction in packaging material intensity and Unilever an 18 percent reduction.Exciting sustainable packaging developments emerged from the aim to remove chemicals of concern. Coop in Denmark led the way when the retailer stopped selling microwave popcorn until it could offer its private brand product without the harmful chemicals typically used on the inside of the bag. The new bag was not only free of the chemicals of concern but also became recyclable.There has been a growing effort across other products to remove these grease-proofing chemicals, called per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) that are used on paper-based packaging. While paper should be recyclable, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition stated that intentionally added PFAS makes a package not widely recyclable, and Norway is set to ban its use. Footprint was one of the first companies to offer fiber-based packages that are PFAS-free and certified compostable.About 5 percent of U.S. households have access to curbside composting collection ¡X a long way from being a widely available circularity solution. Bioplastics, while sometimes compostable, can be recyclable. In 2009, Coca-Cola launched a bottle made with 30 percent bio-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET). By 2015, it had a 100 percent bio-based PET bottle, as other companies are looking to do the same. Further, bio-based polyethylene (PE) is found in recyclable rigid and flexible packages. ?Sustainable packaging is not yet a reality, but there has been progress with reducing packaging weight, sourcing fiber responsibly and exciting developments in material health and bio-based options. There remains a notable gap in building a circular packaging system. ?Reusable options are emerging, but still niche, and closing the loop with packaging is faced with price premiums for recovered material and low recycling rates, especially for plastic packages. The launch of the New Plastics Economy Commitment in 2018 spurred over 200 businesses, including the largest companies such as Walmart, Target, Nestle and Unilever to aim for 100 percent reusable, recyclable and compostable plastic packaging by 2025. ?These ambitious targets and related initiatives have brought extensive collaboration within and across industries, bringing hope for the ingredients necessary for progress: efficient and safe design, responsibly sourced materials and a circular packaging system.',\n",
              " 'Almost exactly 12 long, long months ago, I pontificated about the \"roaring\" decade to come for artificial intelligence. While 2020 was completely bonkers for so many reasons, all five areas where I predicted AI would have the most demonstrable impact ¡X energy management (8 billion in spending from 2020 to 2024), improving soil conditions (360 million more for Indigo Ag), modeling climate risks (Microsoft¡¦s \"Planetary Computer,\" anyone?), protecting biodiversity and boosting supply chain traceability ¡X continued to progress.Against the odds of a pandemic-distracted economy, 2020 turned out to be a breakthrough year not just for practical applications of AI, but also for \"climate tech\" ¡X solutions ranging from agtech to zero-emissions transportation to industrial decarbonization approaches.?Consider these highlights:In the spirit of looking ahead and bidding this terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year goodbye, here are what the trendlines suggest could be five big climate-tech stories in 2021.3 billion. That¡¦s the aggregate amount that just Microsoft (1 billion) and Amazon (2 billion) pledged during 2020 to spend on climate-tech innovation.Both have started spending: Microsoft¡¦s first money went to Energy Impact Partners, a coalition of utilities backing a portfolio of energy startups. Amazon¡¦s first deals included CarbonCure, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian and Turntide Technologies.The two tech giants are far from the only big corporate investors willing to spend ¡X as demonstrated by the recent launch of Third Derivative, created by Rocky Mountain Institute and New Energy Nexus. One of the more recent declarations came from United Airlines, which will make a \"multimillion-dollar\" investment in 1PointFive, a carbon capture venture affiliated with Occidental Petroleum. (See theme No. 2.)In mid-December, British fossil fuels company BP bought a majority stake (the amount wasn¡¦t disclosed) in Finite Carbon, the biggest U.S. forest carbon offset developer. During the same week, Shell Ventures doubled down on its investment in ZeroAvia, a company working on hydrogen-electric powertrains for zero-emission airplanes.As big oil scrambles for ways to keep existing wells and extraction sites open as long as possible, expect more climate-tech dabbling.?In December, TerraCycle, the upcycling company making a big bet on the concept of reusable packaging through its Loop venture, closed a 25 million Series A round for the service.That wasn¡¦t the only notable investment for a circular economy startup this fall: in early September, battery recycling venture Redwood Materials ¡X started by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel ¡X emerged from stealth with a reported 40 million in funding.Also in September, BlackRock disclosed that it had raised 900 million for a fund dedicated to circular economy ventures in the first year.While there have been dedicated funds for circular economy ventures, notably Closed Loop Partners, these moves signal growing mainstream interest. Even if the investors don¡¦t actually use that phrase, which brings us to .I¡¦m listing this right after the circular economy for a reason: There¡¦s often a circular bent to the business model of the startups cropping up in this space.Consider these three ventures brought to my attention by Cody Simms, senior vice president of Techstars: Phoenix Tailings, which recently received 1.35 million in seed funding for its focus on recovering materials from \"tailings\" ponds associated with mining operations; Queen of Raw, which raised 1.5 million for its approach to keeping \"deadstock\" fabrics out of landfills and incinerators; and Renewal Mill, which makes flour out of byproducts related to the production of other plant-based products, such as oat milk.?The economic reboot kickstarted by the COVID-19 pandemic has companies around the world rethinking their systems and supply chains. We¡¦ll be hearing more about companies focused on turning carbon into value. Among the ones finding funders are concrete company CarbonCure (see theme No. 1) and kin such as CarbiCrete, ECOncrete or Solidia; and Carbon Upcycling, creating materials from captured carbon dioxide emissions.?When air pollution monitoring venture Aclima snagged 40 million in funding in November (including from the aforementioned Microsoft fund), it was notable for two big reasons: Investments in woman-led startups, as well as those founded by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) entrepreneurs, are still relatively rare; and Aclima emphasizes its ability to address public health concerns, especially those linked to communities of color.?Aclima co-founder and CEO Davida Herzl told me there was a \"total transformation\" in thinking in the marketplace over the past six months, as the company was closing its round. \"Entrepreneurs will be advancing equity on the climate side,\" she said.As just one example of the impact, in late September, Cox Enterprises shifted the focus of its next social impact accelerator program with Techstars to prioritize startups dedicated to addressing systemic racism. And in mid-December, Greenlining Institute published a guide meant to help climate-tech startups address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion.I also encourage you to familiarize yourself with the model espoused by Elemental Excelerator, which encourages startups to embrace an \"equity in, equity out\" mindset as part of its Equity & Access Track. That is, bringing in diverse individuals through inclusive hiring, cultural, mentorship and supply chain practices, and projecting out into the community by anticipating unintended consequences and prioritizing economic benefits.Sara Chandler, managing director?for the program, told me that participants are encouraged to think about diversity, equity and inclusion holistically as part of their business model rather than as something to prioritize \"later\" or \"after.\" Elemental works with the startups to design projects that include local community organizations, an idea that it calls \"Square Partnerships.\"?One participating company, reforestation specialist DroneSeed, is testing a model to mitigate the seasonality of its jobs. The idea is that employees might perform local field work part of the year, while rotating into administrative roles at other times.?Indeed, job creation ¡X especially in BIPOC communities ¡X is one of the biggest places where climate-tech startups could demonstrate their broader value as the economy recovers. \"This is a moment to be a beacon,\" Chandler said.With that, I bid adieu to 2020 and welcome the possibilities of 2021. Wishing you a happy and healthy New Year¡¦s weekend.',\n",
              " 'It was a very long year. True, just 366 days (it was a leap year, after all), each one, I¡¦m told, containing only the standard 24 hours. But it was much, much longer than that.Remember 2019? Neither do I.To recall some of the key developments, as I have done each December for more than a decade, I¡¦ve plumbed the nearly 1,300 stories, columns and analyses we\\'ve published on GreenBiz.com since the dawn of 2020 ¡X a.k.a. the beforetime ¡X accentuating the positive, seeking signs of progress and hope. We need such reminders to get us through these challenging times.And, perhaps, to set us on a more bullish course for 2021.Here, in no particular order, are five storylines that I found encouraging during the 12 months just ending. (All links are to stories published on GreenBiz.com during 2020.) What would you add to the list?The rise of electric vehicles has been a perennial story for nearly a decade, but 2020 saw the pace of change accelerate. Indeed, in January, my colleague Katie Fehrenbacher predicted that 2020 would be a key year for EVs. She was right.Both the private and public sectors delivered big wins for the electrification of transportation. California¡¦s governor signed a history-making executive order, banning sales of new gas-powered cars within 15 years. Britain upped the ante, with a similar ban but within a decade, helped by McDonald¡¦s plan to install EV chargers at its U.K. drive-thru restaurants. On the supply side, General Motors and Volkswagen planned major EV rollouts.Ultimately, how fast these markets rev up depends on demand from fleet buyers. Amazon continued its aggressive EV buying plans, as did both Walmart and IKEA.One reason for all this: Batteries continue their journey down the price-experience curve, where increased demand lowers prices, further pumping up demand. New technologies are helping, many still in early stages. Some are specifically geared toward truck and bus fleets, an indication that the markets for medium- and heavy-duty EVs are about to kick into high gear.Fashion is another long-simmering environmental story that finally has reached a boiling point. The issues are many, from the resources needed to grow cotton or produce synthetic fabrics, usually from petroleum feedstocks, to the waste that ends up in landfills, especially for inexpensive and trendy clothing items that often have a short useful life.In 2020, several new developments helped put sustainability in fashion. For example, the nonprofit Textile Exchange?launched a Material Change Index, enabling manufacturers to integrate a preferred fiber and materials strategy into their products. It also?launched a Corporate Fiber and Materials Benchmark to help the fashion and textile industry take action on biodiversity.Circular models made the rounds, starting with the design department, where a lot of negative environmental and social impacts are baked into garments, usually unwittingly. Adidas and H&M Group?teamed up for a project to recycle old garments and fibers into new items for major brands. German sportswear company adidas committed to using only recycled polyester across its supply chain by 2024. Markets for secondhand clothing racked up sales, including recommerce, where companies sell their own reclaimed and refurbished goods back to customers.In the wings:?startups touting a new generation of textiles, production methods and business models, suggesting a lot more innovations in store.Saving and planting trees has been a cornerstone of environmental action pretty much since Day One. (Hence, the often-epithetic moniker \"treehugger.\") And pressing companies to eliminate deforestation in their supply chains has long been an activist focus.Now, companies themselves are seeing the business benefits of proactive forestry policies.First, there¡¦s risk mitigation ¡X ensuring \"a company¡¦s ability to sell products into a global supply chain,\" as a BlackRock executive put it. It¡¦s not just the climate impacts of concern to investors. Deforestation and human rights abuses often go hand-in-hand ¡X \"there¡¦s almost a direct correlation,\" said another investor ¡X an additional layer of risk for companies from neglecting forests and those who live and work there.And then there¡¦s the opportunity for companies to offset their emissions, as trees are a natural climate solution that can help draw down greenhouse gases, especially firms adopting net-zero commitments (see below). Microsoft, JetBlue and Royal Dutch Shell are among those seeking to offset a portion of their carbon footprint by investing in forest protection and reforestation.Finally, there are the innovators ¡X entrepreneurs who see gold in all that green. Silicon Valley venture capitalists are beginning to branch out into forestry-related startups ¡X companies such as SilviaTerra and Pachama that provide enabling technologies to facilitate forestry projects. These entrepreneurs likely saw opportunity in the Trillion Trees initiative launched in early 2020.Of course, success requires stopping deforestation in the first place, especially in tropical rainforests. And that remains a problem. Half of the companies most reliant on key commodities that have a negative impact on forests ¡X palm oil, soy, beef, leather, timber, and pulp and paper ¡X don¡¦t have a publicly stated policy on deforestation, according to one report.Still, some firms are making progress. Mars, for example, announced that its palm oil ¡X used in food and pet care products ¡X is now deforestation-free after shrinking the number of mills it works with from 1,500 to a few hundred, a clear-cut sign that progress is possible.For all the talk about Big Ag and Big Food, there¡¦s a growing recognition of the smaller players in the food chain, from farmers and producers to those who prepare and serve meals. And, of course, the 821 million or so humans who face food insecurity, according to the United Nations. And that stat was from 2018, long before this year¡¦s pandemic and global recession created millions more hungry bellies.With restaurants closed and other foodservice operations curtailed, one lingering question is what the world¡¦s largest food companies are doing to help their suppliers and other partners.\"Retailers and brands are recognizing that if they don¡¦t step in to help their producers and distributors, the links holding together those supply chains may crack in ways that aren¡¦t easily repaired,\" my colleague Elsa Wenzel reported back in June.Collecting uneaten food or unsellable produce for distribution to those in need is one activity that accelerated during the pandemic. A newish concept, \"upcycled food\"?¡X goods that \"use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment\" ¡X is being promoted by a nonprofit consortium called the Upcycled Food Association.Increased concern for farmers is also on the menu. Fair Trade certified crops continue to rise, ensuring a living wage for many smallholder farmers, and there¡¦s growing interest in supporting Indigenous farmers, who have long practiced regenerative techniques. The Regenerative Organic Alliance developed a standard to support farmers who promote soil health.All this will require making capital and assistance available to growers around the world, including the data and analytics that increasingly are core to 21st-century farming. And to do this quickly, before the ravages of a changing climate create further hardships for both food producers and consumers around the world.And finally, zero ¡X perhaps a fitting coda to a year that boasts two of them in its name. What began just a couple years ago blossomed into a full-on movement as the number of net-zero commitments doubled in less than a year.The list of companies making such commitments cut across sectors and international borders, among them BP, Delta, Facebook, HSBC, Nestl?, Walmart, even Rolls Royce. Verizon, Indian IT services giant Infosys and British consumer goods brand Reckitt Benckiser became the first global companies to join Amazon\\'s Climate Pledge initiative, committing to reach \"carbon neutrality\" by 2040.Some went further. Microsoft said it would become \"carbon negative\" within a decade, with a stretch goal to remove all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975. The travel-intensive strategy firm BCG said it aspires to be \"climate positive\" by removing more carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere than it emits.But getting to zero ¡X or neutral or positive or some other goal ¡X is not without controversy. As one report noted, net-zero commitments vary widely in terms of their metrics and transparency, among other things. That is, no single standard governs the way net-zero is defined or measured, or how it should be communicated. As such, net-zero could soon be in the crosshairs of activists eager to point out corporate greenwash.Help could be on the way. In September, the Science Based Targets initiative unveiled plans to develop a global standard for corporate net-zero goals, including the role of carbon offsets, a practice whose massive expansion is itself problematic and controversial. How it gets resolved will be an enduring storyline for 2021 and beyond.Those were hardly the only 2020 storylines of note. There was a significant uptick of Wall Street interest in?environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting ¡K a surge of attention by companies to?environmental justice ¡K the continued rise and empowerment of?corporate sustainability professionals.Oh, and the advent of a new U.S. presidential administration that?promises to reengage with business and the global community on addressing the climate crisis.That is to say, 2020 wasn¡¦t all about the pandemic, recession and you-know-who.If that¡¦s not enough, here ¡X in alphabetical order by company ¡X are a baker¡¦s dozen other hopeful headlines from the past 12 months:I invite you to?follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Monday morning newsletter,?GreenBuzz, and listen to?GreenBiz 350, my weekly podcast, co-hosted with Heather Clancy.',\n",
              " 'While 2020 brought a host of challenges to the country, many states and cities still forged ahead with actions to address the climate impacts of a stubborn sector: buildings. Across the United States, local leaders are acknowledging the climate, economic and health impacts of burning fossil fuels in buildings and accelerating the transition to modern, clean electric appliances.From all-electric building codes to heat pump deployments, here is a look back at some of the most noteworthy state-level progress on building electrification this year. Together, these developments demonstrate the growing realization among policymakers that eliminating emissions from buildings is integral to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Nowhere is this more evident than in President-elect Joe Biden¡¦s ambitious climate plan, which aims to slash the carbon footprint of U.S. building stock 50 percent by 2035.Many cities and states enacted new laws, updated building codes and advanced regulatory action to phase out gas appliances and ensure homes are heated and powered with clean electricity.???Several states detailed the actions they will take to electrify space heating on the road to eliminating fossil fuel use in buildings, while others opened formal regulatory proceedings to draft plans that will transition utilities away from gas distribution.???A few states convened working groups to address the overwhelming need to begin electrifying buildings as a vital part of their climate solutions.?With these developments, 2021 promises to be an even more important year for building electrification. Coupled with the new administration¡¦s strong support, more states and cities are poised to make important progress on requiring all-electric appliances in new construction, phasing out gas appliances in existing buildings, and winding down the gas distribution system to protect the climate and future ratepayers alike.',\n",
              " 'You only have to look at the annual tech ritual that is the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) ¡X which kicked off in Vegas this weekend amid a blur of oversized TVs, 5G phones and foldable tablets ¡X to see how important electric vehicles will be in 2020.?Many of the big and small automakers that sell passenger vehicles will be showing off their newest electric models, such as Ford\\'s Mustang Mach-E, Nissan\\'s electric crossover concept Ariya, Fiat Chrysler\\'s plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler and Mercedes-Benz\\'s EQC 400 4Matic and Vision EQS vehicles. Sunday at CES, Chinese EV maker Byton showed off its M-Byte (most famous for its 48-inch wrap-around dashboard screen), due out later this year (see picture below). Other automakers that are hosting press conferences or booths this week include Audi, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and Daimler.?While CES has long been shifting to a \"car show disguised as a tech conference,\" this year it would seem especially quaint if an automaker premiered a gas or diesel-powered model. The future is electric, and CES is an event all about looking forward. 2020 will indeed be the \"year of the electric car\" particularly across Europe, says the Guardian. Cities in Europe are banning diesel vehicles from city centers while European automakers launch flagship EVs with names like the Fiat 500 and the Mini. 175 EV models will be on sale by the end of 2020 for European consumers, such as Volkswagen\\'s id3, up from fewer than 100 right now.?European vehicle electrification will have profound effects on Europe\\'s carbon emissions, but it also will present a challenging transformation for European auto sectors. Germany, for example, is expected to shed jobs as plants close that make internal combustion parts. Electric vehicles are simpler to make and require fewer parts, meaning a tightened supply chain. But you can also point to the German auto industry\\'s resistance to change as an equally big challenge.?In China, long the world\\'s largest market for EVs, it\\'s unclear if there will be big growth in 2020. The Chinese government cut EV subsidies substantially in mid-2019 and demand for Chinese EVs is still feeling those effects. However, China remains the world\\'s most important EV market.Tesla\\'s CEO and founder Elon Musk is betting the company\\'s future growth this year on its ability to sell the Model 3 at a lower price in China by making it locally in a 5 billion factory in Shanghai. Last week Tesla handed over its first \"made-in-China\" vehicles to a batch of Tesla Chinese employees, and today in Shanghai, Musk plans to lead a ceremony to hand off the first locally made cars to Chinese customers.?Speaking of Tesla, over the holiday break, the company announced it had shipped 367,500 vehicles in 2019, achieving Musk\\'s annual sales target and leading to renewed enthusiasm and a soaring stock price. Shares are trading well above the 420 stock price that Musk fancied (reaching close to 450 per share Monday), and this year the company is launching its Model Y vehicle (see picture below).Overall, in the U.S., automakers are planning to have a little over 100 electric vehicles on sale by the end of the 2020,?says Axios. New models this year in addition to Tesla\\'s Model Y include Ford\\'s Mach-E, Audi\\'s e-tron Sportback, Volvo\\'s XC40 Recharge and Volkswagen\\'s ID4 Crozz. Tesla\\'s Model 3 was by far the best selling electric vehicle of 2019, but the competition is heating up this year.?\\nThe electrification trend isn\\'t only about cars or heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses. Sales and access to electric scooters and electric bikes will continue to be a hot trend in 2020, and many are showing off at CES this week. Scooter companies are starting to focus on making scooters more robust and longer-lasting, to avoid the ultra-short lifecycles that have plagued the last couple of years.?And if you\\'re following the steady tech drumbeat coming out of CES, expect to see more weird and wacky electric micromobility vehicles, such as electric skateboards and some of those electric one-wheel balancing devices. I see some of these rolling through the bike lane in San Francisco periodically, but CES is the place for these gadgets to get noticed.?2020 isn\\'t just a big year for electric vehicles ¡X it\\'s kicking off a decade that will see electric vehicles reach price parity with their fossil fuel-powered counterparts.Analysts keep nudging that date forward, but now suggest it could happen as early as 2022 for certain models and markets, namely large vehicles in Europe. McKinsey just put out a report that says globally there will be over 400 new EV models in the pipeline over the next three years, compared to 136 in 2018.?',\n",

The year when renewables set multiple records and electric vehicles were rushed to market.In the United Kingdom, it was the year when the carbon target for 2030 was strengthened. The year when billions of pounds were earmarked for low carbon infrastructure and overseas fossil fuel financing was halted. The year when every politician talked of green recovery and the unerring economic and moral logic of the net zero transition ¡X?and the public agreed with them.By the end of 2020 two-thirds of the world economy and over half of global emissions will be either covered by net-zero targets or have such targets in the pipeline. The collective pledges and strategies put forward by governments, if enacted as promised, will put the world on track for 2.1 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 ¡X?a still dangerous level of climate change but a remarkable achievement given just five years ago the projection was for around 3C. Best of all, Donald Trump is packing up his crayons from the Oval Office.It would be nice to close out a review of the year there, with a hymn to a tipping point start to a critical decade when the evidence that the Paris Agreement is working and global emissions are peaking became overwhelming, when the foundations for the next phase of the green industrial revolution were decisively laid. Nice, but dishonest.Because if emissions did peak in 2019, if political and corporate leaders fully embraced the need for credible and ambitious climate action, if oil suddenly looked like a high risk legacy fuel, it was in large part because we were surrounded by death and destruction.2020 was the year of the plague. A year of tragedy and trauma for millions of people, and insecurity and claustrophobia for billions more, with a side order of crushing governmental incompetence to cap it off. The hope is we will never see its like again, but there are no guarantees of that. Indeed, one of the biggest victims of the pandemic has been our narcissistic sense of invulnerability. The next pandemic could be worse still.Throughout the rolling health and economic crises, the green economy and its fellow travelers have been engaged in an admirable hunt for silver linings. They even managed to find a few.Emissions may have plummeted largely due to a hugely damaging economic contraction, but the downward trend was amplified by the effectiveness of renewables in making a record contribution to the grid and the productivity-saving performance of remote working technologies.It may have been a psychological ploy to enable self-preservation in the most challenging of circumstances, but huge numbers of people really did feel a greater connection with, and appreciation of, nature; an understanding of the value of local community; and an awareness of the immense risks that flow from our overexploitation of natural resources.At the political level all but the most extreme of libertarian ideologues were forced to reckon with the critical importance of effective and proactive government, as well as the immense threat posed by long-tail environmental risks, the interconnectedness of public and economic health and the basic truth that mitigation is always more effective than adaptation.?But as I argued at the start of the crisis, none of these gains feels entrenched, and they in no way compensate for the grieving, chaos and loneliness we\\'ve all had to endure. One hope when the pandemic first struck was that it would teach governments the invaluable lesson that when faced with a complex, multi-faceted, severe and exponential threat the best course of action is to throw everything at mitigating it as swiftly as possible or else risk being overwhelmed. The theory was the lessons learned could be usefully applied to a climate crisis where inaction is similarly punished and lag times and uncertain scenarios mean early measures and the astute application of the precautionary principle tend to pay off. But, in the U.K. at least, we are almost a year into the pandemic and as the death toll passes 60,000 and a new strain of the virus threatens to inundate health services, the prime minister is still failing to apply these simple lessons to the coronavirus itself, let alone absorb them for tackling other longer term threats.The pandemic may feel like an inflection point, but it is unclear if the ensuing acceleration will drive us headlong towards a utopian clean tech future or a dystopian pollutocratic catastrophe. Or, most likely, a mix of both.The world has been stuck at a crossroads ever since the financial crash of 2008 when world leaders moved swiftly to patch up a dysfunctional and inherently volatile machine, and then for various reasons largely failed to trade it in for a newer, cleaner, fairer model. Progress was made, most notably in the form of the Paris Agreement\\'s celebration of multilateralism and the green investment and technology trends it helped accelerate. But the inability to deliver more fundamental reforms fueled a painful backlash that gave us Brexit, Trump, and, much more concerning still, Trumpism.The net result was five years of going round in circles, a period when every good intention or decisive step forward was swiftly followed by a bout of tribalism, incompetence or outright corruption. When the promise of finally sorting out environmentally destructive farming subsidies had to be delivered in tandem with tailbacks at the border and the poisoning of relations with our closest neighbors. When demand for electric vehicles rose alongside demand for SUVs. When every renewables development seemed to come with a new runway.?The pandemic and the unrelenting march of the climate crisis offers a chance to break this vicious cycle after a long decade of self-defeating stasis and actually pick a path forward. As people under 40 reflect on the second once-in-a-century economic crisis of their short careers, the critical question remains as to which route we will select.In her brilliant essay on the pandemic, novelist Zadie Smith started by quoting that rarest of things, a moment of honesty from Trump. \"I wish we could have our old life back,\" he said. \"We had the greatest economy that we\\'ve ever had, and we didn\\'t have death.\" It may have been expressed with characteristic clumsiness, but the president surely spoke for billions of people. Polls may show that most of the population worldwide want no truck with a return to \"normality,\" but our understanding of human nature says different.In mid-December, the FT\\'s Henry Mance provided an insightful reflection on what comes next, warning that many of the more sustainable behaviors prompted by the pandemic are unlikely to stick. \"Imagine if, by late 2021, much of Europe and the U.S. has been vaccinated against the disease,\" he wrote. \"Those people who haven\\'t lost their jobs have amassed savings. Imagine their desire to make up for lost time: parties, festivals, travel. What if the new normal looks quite like the old normal?\"The big fear is not that people embrace the opportunities for reconnection that vaccines would bring ¡X?who could possibly blame them ¡X and environmentalists should be very wary of conforming to the finger-wagging killjoy clich? as consumerism and travel inevitably come roaring back. No, the concern is that at the macro level the opportunity to \"build back better\" is squandered. That political and business leaders repeat the mistakes of 2008 and duck the structural reforms that are so urgently required if the 2020s really are to be defined by the turbocharged decarbonization of the global economy. As Mance concluded: \"Normality is something to strive for; it is also something to regret. We have no reason to think this will be the last pandemic of our lifetimes. In climate change, humanity faces arguably the biggest collective problem it has ever faced. If the biggest lesson that we take from 2020 is that it\\'s possible to work from home two days a week, then we have fallen short.\"The temptation to return to an unsustainable \"normal\" will be everywhere, especially as the next phase of the clean tech revolution ¡X?the EVs, heat pumps and green building retrofits ¡X?requires significantly more investment and disruption to people\\'s day-to-day lives. Too many governments already have reached for the familiar comfort of carbon-intensive stimulus packages to revive their locked-down economies. Others have demonstrated the continuing dearth of political nerve and governing competence that will be essential to the net-zero transition, imploding trust in collective action through their deadly bungling of the response to the virus and arrogant dismissal of exponential risks. A government that cannot bring itself to sack advisers who breach public health rules or level with people about the health risks associated with Christmas travel until after train tickets have been bought and turkeys ordered is unlikely to suddenly find the backbone and communication skills required to avoid the political minefield that awaits as the net-zero transition accelerates.On both sides of the Atlantic opponents of climate action keep their powder dry, waiting for Brexit to open the door for a fresh assault on environmental ambitions and President-elect Joe Biden to provide a left wing bogeyman in the White House. They are not discouraged at all by the fact they are out of step with a large majority of the public, economic logic and basic physics. As costs plummet and clean technologies mature even faster than their advocates expected, governments\\' inability to stand up to vested interests and a culture war-infused backlash against environmentalism remain the biggest threats to a net-zero transition that may be inevitable but is still proceeding too slowly. As President Barack Obama once observed, \"There is such a thing as being too late on climate change.\" Delay is the enemy.Which is why the alternative history of 2020 is so immensely important. Because during a year when many within the green economy feared the global health crisis would distract from the effort to tackle the climate crisis, precisely the opposite has happened. Progress has not just been made, it has accelerated. The pursuit of complete decarbonization and full spectrum climate action has been normalized like never before. There remains a big gap between ambition and action, and countless challenges and hypocrisies remain. But millions of businesses, investors, governments?and individuals used the start of a new decade dominated by tragedy to publicly select the path that leads to a cleaner, healthier,?more prosperous net-zero emission future. 2021 offers the chance to not just cement those gains, but build on them.

Still others are driving sustainability at nonprofit organizations and consultancies. All combined, this year¡¦s cohort reports to offices in 12 nations across six continents, including Brazil, Canada, China, India, Lithuania, New Zealand and Rwanda. In the United States, they hail from 15 cities, from Albuquerque, New Mexico to New York City ¡X and several emigrated to the U.S. in childhood. In addition, most of the honorees find the time to exercise global citizenship beyond their day jobs, mentoring youth, hosting a podcast and launching peer networking groups. Some have helped with disaster relief. Others have lost their own homes to natural disasters. The GreenBiz 30 Under 30 candidates for 2021 were nominated by GreenBiz readers and community members around the world and selected by the GreenBiz editorial team. We¡¦d like to express our appreciation to the World Business Council for Sustainable Business and Net Impact for helping to cast a global net for this year¡¦s nominees. Zack Angelini, 29 Senior Environmental Stewardship Manager, Timberland; Malden, Massachusetts Growing up outside of Boston, Zack Angelini spent summers swimming, but one polluted river was off limits. \"I just remember being super mad about knowing that the way society was operating could ruin something that should be so beautiful and fun,\" he says of his first encounter with the idea that human activities negatively affect the environment. Decades later, at iconic apparel company Timberland, Angelini works closely with product teams to mitigate the environmental impact of its boots, jackets and accessories. In five years, he has moved up from an internship to lead the company¡¦s global product sustainability strategy. Angelini was instrumental in setting two signature goals for 2030. The first is for 100 percent of products to be designed with the circular economy in mind. The second is a commitment to sourcing 100 percent of the natural materials Timberland uses from regenerative agriculture, such as leather for boots. Angelini manages the sustainability aspects of both Timberland¡¦s partnership with Other Half Processing to build a more responsible leather supply chain, and its partnership with Terra Genesis International to build the world¡¦s first regenerative rubber supply system for footwear.\\n\"The opportunity with regenerative agriculture is that we can go beyond just reducing the negative impact of a product creation and actually restore the environment that we\\'re sourcing from and potentially have this net positive impact,\" Angelini says. And that¡¦s his hope for the apparel and footwear industry as a whole. Vartan Badalian, 28\\nEV100 Program Manager for North America, The Climate Group; New York City Vartan Badalian¡¦s mother has a favorite story to prove that being born on Earth Day imbued him with an innate concern for the environment. One day while sitting in the car, she attempted to toss a piece of gum into a nearby trash can and missed. Before she had a chance to pick it up, 4-year-old Vartan scolded her. Today, he makes his living nudging others ¡X namely corporate executives ¡X toward a decarbonized sustainable future. As the North American program manager for the Climate Group¡¦s EV100 program, Badalian works to get large companies to commit to 100 percent electric mobility by 2030, then helps them replace global fleets with electric vehicles, deploy charging stations and affect government policy. As of the latest count, 102 corporations have committed to the 2030 (or better) goal ¡X including Ikea, Genentech and Lyft ¡X and more than 170,000 EVs have been deployed. Badalian received an environmental law degree from Lewis & Clark Law School, which helped shape his policy work, he says. He served as corporate counsel on policy at Greenspot Smart Mobility, an EV charging startup, after clerking at various organizations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Natural Resources Defense Council. \"One thing I¡¦ve noticed is when you¡¦re extremely passionate about something and it¡¦s genuine, you don¡¦t need to do so much convincing,\" Badalian says. \"Just keep doing what you¡¦re doing, and others can recognize that passion. They pick up on it.\" Mayane Barudin, 27\\nRegional Director and Tribal Liaison, Vote Solar; Albuquerque, New Mexico Mayane Barudin¡¦s inspiration and calling come from the same place: her culture. \"Everything we do follows the sun,\" says Barudin, who grew up in the Kewa Pueblo (formerly Santo Domingo) in New Mexico. \"Solar is a new technology to be able to do so.\" Today, Barudin works on state clean energy policy, collaborating closely with tribal leaders to ensure community buy-in and outcomes that are equitable. Most recently, Barudin led a tribal task force with the nonprofit group Vote Solar to support New Mexico\\'s new law enabling tribes and pueblos to access community solar programs. She came to Vote Solar following an internship with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and after earning a master¡¦s in environmental change and management at the University. \"I come from a close-knit pueblo where we each have our own skills and ability to help our community,\" says Barudin, who also has worked with the nonprofit Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council and still volunteers with the National Indian Law Library. \"I\\'ve always been an energy nerd and I just knew that was my place. So it feels good to give back in a way that I know I can help.\"\\nConnecting her heritage with future opportunities is threaded throughout her work. Among the challenges is advocating the complexity of the regulatory patchwork among utilities, states and tribes, which are sovereign nations. \"I envision a day where all of the tribes stand to benefit the most from the clean energy transition,\" she says. \"It\\'s kind of a long-lived dream.\"  Brock Battochio, 28 Co-Founder & Lead Engineer, Planetary Hydrogen; Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada Brock Battochio originally aspired to play ice hockey competitively, and served as defenseman on the team at Carleton University in Ottawa. However, after suffering his 12th concussion in a national championship, he decided to find value in another cause. \"What really resonated with me was the fact that I would always have conversations with friends or family about climate change, and I would either be given one of two answers: that either it doesn¡¦t exist, or that someday either technology or ¡¥they¡¦ would solve the problem,\" Battochio says. An entrepreneurial spirit led him to become the theoretical \"they\" to address the climate crisis, starting with studying sustainable and renewable energy engineering. Battochio hoped to become a CEO by age 26 ¡X and he did just that, leveraging business aptitude with technical skills to co-found Planetary Hydrogen. The Ottawa-based startup is bringing to scale a process that generates hydrogen by capturing carbon dioxide from the air, then storing it within seawater, mimicking the ocean¡¦s natural processes to create a carbon sink. It¡¦s seeking to capture no less than a gigaton of CO2 per year by 2035. Battochio has leveraged his business aptitude and engineering skills to help generate 4.5 million in funding and to develop the company¡¦s first-generation plant. The company also snagged a partnership with Shopify, which has agreed to purchase all the negative emissions produced from Planetary Hydrogen¡¦s pilot plant, set to come online in 2022. Stacia Betley, 29. Sustainability Integration Manager, Amy¡¦s Kitchen; Petaluma, California Amy¡¦s Kitchen, whose pot pies helped warm the public to organic food in the 1980s, has set its sights on healing the planet. It¡¦s Stacia Betley¡¦s job to co-author that recipe within the three-person sustainability team at the 2,700-person company. Lately, they¡¦ve been diving deep to understand the company\\'s impacts and responsibilities as a purveyor of vegan canned soups, frozen burritos and gluten-free grain bowls. Betley¡¦s mantra ¡X to work hard and be kind ¡X reflects the image projected by the values-driven vegetarian brand, offered by most grocery store brands and at its own California drive-through eateries. As COVID came to dominate 2020, she helped donate more than 600,000 meals and 100,000 pounds of packaging to food banks. After college at the University of Vermont, Betley twisted a marketing role at merino wool clothier Point6 into a sustainability-focused one, which included implementing the Higg Index, a suite of tools for measuring supply-chain sustainability. One current project involves working with MBA students at the University of Oregon, where she completed the same degree, to help Amy¡¦s Kitchen understand how it saves on emissions by selling plant-based products. Betley feels heartened to see a young generation taking a stand on climate change. \"Individual impact is important, but when I come to work every day I get to have impact at scale,\" she says. \"Originally, we did these things because it was the right thing to do. But now the reasons are endless, right? There\\'s a business case, it\\'s in our DNA. Our consumers are not only asking for it, but expecting it.\"  Briana Buckles, 29 Sustainability Manager, East West Tea Company; Eugene, Oregon Serving as a United States Marine in the Asia Pacific region, Briana Buckles often witnessed extreme poverty. The first lieutenant managed logistics and transportation for humanitarian missions and exercises, including typhoon relief in Fiji and Saipan. \"The combination of these experiences really fueled my desire to continue a career path where I could focus on viable solutions to global poverty . while mitigating impacts of climate change,\" Buckles says. During a stint in East Timor supporting a training exercise with the Timorese military, Buckles was searching for locally grown coffee in its caf?s. But she noticed they only served pre-packaged, mass-produced, instant coffee grown elsewhere. Coffee beans have been grown in East Timor for more than 400 years. \"To me, this really magnified the fact that there¡¦s a huge global disconnect between the people who grow large-scale agricultural commodity crops and those who consume them,\" Buckles says. While earning an MBA at the University of Oregon, with an emphasis on sustainable business practices, she worked part time at East West Tea, the company behind Yogi Tea, before serving as its first full-time sustainability manager. The aspect of the job that excites Buckles most is working with farmers and wild harvesters (those who harvest plants from their natural and \"wild\" habitat), who provide ingredients in more than 40 countries. \"There\\'s so much opportunity to support them, to support the human beings who grow these crops,\" she says. \"If you pick up a box of our tea and there are 16 different ingredients on it, those ingredients in many cases will have come from 16 different countries and countless different villages and communities around the world.\" Maria Eduarda Camargo, 24 Founder, Pantys; S?o Paulo, Brazil Maria Eduarda Camargo wants to talk about menstruating. The 24-year-old from S?o Paulo is working to destigmatize the subject and make it comfortable, fashionable and sustainable in the process. Periods can be a taboo topic, but Camargo sees an opportunity for innovation. Her family has long worked in the lingerie industry, so women¡¦s underwear is second nature to her. Modernizing the space, though, would require a new approach. She took matters into her own hands in 2017, when she founded the reusable underwear line Pantys, the first of its kind in Latin America. Essentially, sustainable fashion meets women¡¦s health. Camargo and her partner developed absorbent underwear with natural, biodegradable fabric that maintains functionality for an average of 50 washes, or about two years. The company claims to be carbon-neutral, investing in reforestation and offshore wind to offset the emissions associated with its products and operations. Pantys¡¦ products cut down on plastic waste ¡X one person uses up to 15,000 pads and tampons over a lifetime, most of which wind up in landfills, estimates show. Sustainability is important to Camargo¡¦s belief that \"the health of the planet impacts our health,\" she says. \"In Brazil, we are really connected to nature and the Amazon, so I have this conscience that we must take care of it.\" Meanwhile, up to 500 million women and girls globally experience \"period poverty,\" a lack of access to sanitary products and facilities. Pantys has donated over 10,000 pairs to help tackle that problem, including for the Shanekaya and Yawanawa indigenous communities in Brazil. Camargo is proud to improve women¡¦s quality of life. \"You can feel pretty and confident and comfortable using the product,\" she says. Haseena Charania, 29 ESG Communications Strategy Supervisor, UPS; Atlanta The potential of the logistics giant UPS to move the needle in transportation ¡X one of the largest contributors to climate change ¡X is a way for Haseena Charania to protect those who may not have the voice and platform that she does. In leading a piece of the communications strategy for one of the most dynamic companies in the sustainability space, she¡¦s making sure the world knows about its climate work, which includes committing to buy 10,000 electric delivery vehicles, investing heavily in renewable natural gas and working toward a circular economy. A big piece of Charania¡¦s job is sustainability reporting, which helps to hold the company publicly accountable to its goals. Her work also covers diversity initiatives at UPS, including leading publicity for its internal publication, \"Black Voices from Big Brown.\" The seeds of Charania¡¦s passion for sustainability were planted early in life in New York City, where she moved from India as a toddler, by an environmentally focused magnet school and a mother who instilled values beyond money. During graduate school for environmental management and an internship with the United Nations that focused on climate-vulnerable countries, Charania\\'s passions for sustainability and equity crystallized. She launched a consulting firm to help companies launch their sustainability journeys and worked with PwC on supporting underserved populations. \"It¡¦s really work from the ground up; that¡¦s what I try to go in and help with,\" Charania says. Morgan Collins, 28 Head of Sustainable Finance, Starbucks; Seattle Born in Seoul before immigrating to the United States at age 2, Morgan Collins followed his father into a career in finance, working with hedge funds and private equity firms including BlackRock, making the leap to the Starbucks treasury department in 2016. His first taste of the potential for sustainable finance came in 2017 when he led Starbucks in issuing the company¡¦s first sustainability bond issue in a foreign market, Japan. \"But what really got me interested in sustainability was back in investments,\" Collins recalls.  Challenged by the treasurer to find something creative to do with the company¡¦s newly raised funds, he created a ESG corporate cash investment program. \"It was the first time I was really in the driver seat for a sustainable finance initiative and showed me that not only could we be doing more by blending sustainability and finance, but that we should be doing more.\" Now part of the Starbucks sustainability team, Collins created his unique corporate role basically from scratch. Over the past three years, he helped Starbucks create its first ESG money market fund, authored the sustainability team¡¦s first submission for the company¡¦s enterprise risk management process, and successfully petitioned the UN PRI to allow companies to join as signatories. He also co-managed the development of Starbucks¡¦ 2030 sustainability goals and is deeply involved with the team¡¦s environmental justice strategy. \"It¡¦s harder, especially at first, to develop initiatives that have a good value proposition for every stakeholder,\" Collins says. \"It takes more work, more time, more understanding. But that¡¦s how we¡¦re going to make lasting change.\" Chris Dowd, 26 Strategic Partnerships, Social Impact, Google; San Francisco As the youngest member of Google¡¦s Global Product Partnerships team, Chris Dowd has made an impact as an internal diplomat, translating the goals of external stakeholders, including cities, NGOs and startups, for internal development teams from Israel to Singapore to Silicon Valley. His interest in environmental resilience was born in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, after accompanying his father to the region to help with reconstruction. In his three years with the tech giant, Dowd already has been part of the founding team for Google¡¦s Environmental Insights Exploration, which helps midsize cities run emissions analyses, and negotiated an initiative for the Street View fleet to collect more granular air pollution data. More recently, he¡¦s been working on a crisis response tool for wildfires and extreme weather impacts, such as flooding. The project is personal: his childhood home in Santa Rosa, California, burned in the 2020 Glass Fire. \"Just seeing how difficult that is and how quickly an extreme climate change event can rip through a community was extremely powerful for me and a validation of my professional purpose to play a role in this work,\" he says. While at Tufts University, from which he received a bachelor¡¦s in international relations and economics, Dowd was involved with the school¡¦s fossil fuels divestment campaign and interned in the Obama White House. That experience was core to his conviction that addressing climate change will take collaboration from myriad stakeholders across the private and public sectors. \"You have to be aware of what others are doing to do your best within your own lane.\" Francesca Goodman-Smith, 26 Transform Program Leader, Fight Food Waste Co-op Research Center; Brisbane, Australia Growing up with a chef father in seaside New Zealand, where neighbors shared vegetables from their gardens, Francesca Goodman-Smith knew where her food came from. While studying to be a dietitian, she disliked the curriculum¡¦s focus on illness rather than wellness. Goodman-Smith started seeing the crossover between the environmental impacts of how the food system works. Her thesis for a master¡¦s in human nutrition focused on quantifying food waste at supermarkets.  \"I felt like with food waste, I could really work at the prevention side and contribute to something much more global that has a touchpoint for everybody,\" Goodman-Smith says. After earning her degree, she led programs to help Foodstuffs, one of New Zealand¡¦s largest supermarket chains, separate its food waste for use in upcycled products. Goodman-Smith facilitated a program using Foodstuffs¡¦ leftover bread to make beer that was sold back to the store. She also created a certification process and consumer label for upcycled foods that has just launched as a trial in New Zealand; she hopes this approach will expand to grocery stores in the U.S. In April, Goodman-Smith moved to Brisbane, Australia, to start a new job leading transformational change in waste at the research center Fight Food Waste Cooperative. It works to help the Australian food industry become more competitive and sustainable by funding projects to better understand how to reduce supply-chain losses, transform waste resources and educate consumers. As she advances in her career from a regional role to a national one, Goodman-Smith hopes to make change some day at the global level. Ghislain Irakoze, 21 CEO and Founder, Wastezon; Kigali, Rwanda If you survived a garbage landslide, what would your next move be? For Ghislain Irakoze, it was a startup helping boost electronics waste reuse and recycling in Rwanda. It wasn¡¦t his next move, exactly ¡X he survived the accident at a landfill during a school assignment when he was 12 and launched the company at age 18 ¡X but that incident had a lasting impact. \"It inspired me to explore solutions that can be introduced in the community to reduce the waste that goes to landfill,\" he says. \"E-waste is somehow concentrated here in our community, especially in Rwanda and other East African countries.\" While building his company, which connects e-waste sellers to buyers who are often from the recycling industry, Irakoze has served as an adviser and researcher, including with the European Commission and Mastercard Foundation. He recently started as a research fellow at Sustainable Partners, a nonprofit think tank, where he investigates climate justice, circular economy and climate finance issues while laying out policy recommendations for change in the Global South.  For a long time, waste traders in Rwanda have struggled to get a fair price for their materials. When a user downloads Wastezon, they can upload photos of their e-waste and the app will help them determine how to set their price by detecting mineralogical content; the app also connects them with potential buyers. \"We are providing a platform where people can actually get transparency in e-waste trading,\" says Irakoze, noting that over 460 tons of e-waste have been transacted on the Wastezon app. Adrienne Johnson, 29 Associate Engineer, Point Energy Innovations, San Francisco Whether it¡¦s helping schoolgirls build a house of cards for a gummy bear family or engineering decarbonized homes for underserved communities, Adrienne Johnson is advancing some of the most creative and equitable solutions in the built environment. \"What we\\'re trying to do . is show that building and designing in this sustainable way that is healthy for the people who are ultimately going to live there is something that is affordable and can be done for anyone,\" she says of working at the consultancy Point Energy Innovations. Johnson is leading the energy strategy for a one-of-a-kind development breaking ground later this year in a once-redlined, now-gentrifying part of Oakland, California. The complex, 7th and Campbell, features a grocery store, a restaurant and a farm, clustered with 79 affordable, mostly solar-powered homes. Johnson¡¦s earlier work, a few years ago and 10,000 miles away in Cape Town, South Africa, brought to life another area¡¦s long-deferred hopes. She led design and construction for the award-winning, net-positive-energy Parkwood Technology Centre community hub in a previously \"coloureds only\" neighborhood.  The former Girl Scout and once-fellow at the U.S. Green Building Council still makes time to volunteer at STEM workshops for youth and was involved with a nonprofit nudging Oakland middle schoolers into the outdoors. \"Play in engineering and education is really important for inspiring creativity and connections for young people,\" she says. Johnson is also helping to develop a course about decarbonizing buildings for Howard University, which ultimately will feed into an online resource for all schools developed by her employer along with her alma mater, Stanford University.  Jamario Jackson, 29\\nSenior Community Planner, TransForm; Oakland, California California native Jamario Jackson has built his young career on public service. He already has more than a decade of experience in the legislative process and community engagement, from working for a local official in the Bay Area community of Concord during college to interning with public transportation agency AC Transit alongside graduate studies in urban affairs at the University of San Francisco. After working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Jackson joined Transform, an Oakland nonprofit supporting mobility and transportation services toward creating walkable communities. His work includes two high-profile programs facilitating relationships among private companies developing mobility services, community based-organizations and local officials. The first is a collaboration with Lyft bringing ride-sharing and bike-sharing to underserved East Oakland neighborhoods. The second is a partnership with software developer Remix, centered on rethinking the transportation planning decision-making process to become more equitable. Raised in a low-income, single-parent household, Jackson says he feels a weight on his shoulders to make a difference to underserved communities. He draws immense satisfaction from his ability to amplify voices that the private sector might not always hear, at least not directly. \"As individuals, as people of color, no matter how you look at it, I have power, we have power. We might not make all the decisions in our neighborhoods, but we have power.\"  Lina Khan, 29 Senior Sustainability Specialist and Global Design Resilience Practice Area Leader ¡X Government + Defense, Gensler; San Francisco Lina Khan hopes that her job ¡X leading sustainability at global design and architecture firm Gensler ¡X eventually will become obsolete. That¡¦s a tall order; the company already counts 100 million square feet of LEED-certified projects and seeks to wipe out all emissions related to its work in the next decade. Khan helps architects understand and apply energy metrics and carbon modeling to their designs, and also to better consider sustainability attributes on their own.  \"My own goal at Gensler is to make sure everyone that works there feels like they are sustainability specialists in their job,\" Khan says. While a large portion of her work includes leading project management across commercial architecture projects, Khan also dedicates time to her passion in clean energy and energy efficiency. She gained hands-on environmental science experience at the University of California at San Diego before completing a master¡¦s in environmental management at Duke University, during which she worked for REI and Apple. As a woman and a first-generation Pakistani-American, Khan believes it¡¦s important to involve diverse voices. \"We don\\'t exactly have the roadmap to solve this global problem of climate change but at least we\\'re all having conversations in the room about it, and it¡¦s important to make sure that multiple voices are involved as well,\" she says.  Erik Landry, 29 Climate Change Specialist, GRESB; Amsterdam, Netherlands Erik Landry is versatile. He¡¦s been a competitive tennis player and gymnast, he plays piano and guitar, and his career has taken interesting turns. \"It\\'s the interconnections that I find really interesting,\" he says. \"The more fields I can cover, the more I can bring insights from those fields into other fields.\" A chemistry major in college, Landry first worked at Argonne National Laboratory on the material science behind organic photovoltaics, a branch of electronics that deals with conductive organic polymers or small organic molecules. Wanting to see impact beyond a single solar technology, he next learned about the policy side of renewable energy while working in the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s SunShot Initiative. Yet he felt he was still missing a key element of the trifecta for renewable energy development: economics. So, Landry went for a master¡¦s in technology and policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was drawn to the topic of energy consumption. \"I came to realize that if you give people more energy, it doesn\\'t matter if that energy is renewable; they\\'re going to use more energy,\" he says. \"We have to get our consumption under control.\" At MIT, Landry led a working group on climate-related scenario planning to support the goals of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. When the job at GRESB opened, he thought it was ideal. At GRESB (founded as the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark), Landry manages research, projects and partnerships related to climate-risk and resiliency, and develops tools to help real estate asset managers and investors align their portfolios with international climate goals. Bonia Leung, 28 Sustainability Consultant, Environmental Resources Management (ERM); London Bonia Leung didn¡¦t set out to spend four years immersed in Hong Kong¡¦s garbage. She originally applied for a job at the consultancy ERM in environmental health and safety, but it required someone with more experience than the recent college grad had at the time. She needed a proverbial foot in the door. \"The sustainability consulting industry in Hong Kong is quite small and it¡¦s difficult to get in without connections,\" explains Leung, who grew up there. She was inspired to study environmental science and get a master¡¦s degree in environmental engineering and management after a school trip to Singapore showed how the city became one of the most sustainable in the world. Luckily, the folks at ERM thought she¡¦d be more suited for another open position ¡X in waste policy and strategy. \"It was the waste team that wanted me,\" Leung says with a laugh. Since then, she¡¦s grown fascinated with the work and has led a number of notable projects, including two with the Hong Kong government. The densely packed metropolis recycles only about 30 percent of its waste and its landfills have been bursting for years. Leung helped the city devise a plan to separate and collect food waste, and to create a regulatory program to eliminate single-use plastic tableware. Leung, meanwhile, recently decided she was ready to see more of the world, so she spoke with ERM¡¦s waste team in the United Kingdom about transferring to London. \"They said, ¡¥Yeah, we¡¦ll take you on,\\'\" she says. \"I guess they just really like me.\"  Laurence Lloyd Lumagbas, 29 Sustainability and Strategic Risk Advisory Services Manager, Deloitte Southeast Asia; Taguig City, Manila, Philippines Ten years ago, Tropical Storm Washi destroyed Laurence Lloyd Lumagbas¡¦ hometown on the Philippines island of Mindanao. Seeing his city in shambles was, he says, a \"very personal experience of what could happen if we don\\'t live in a sustainable world.\"  It set Lumagbas on his path. \"I was already very interested in the world of business, but that life event made me realize it\\'s important for businesses not just to be commercially focused but to also ¡K create a positive impact in society and the environment.\" Lumagbas studied management economics and took a one-year course in social entrepreneurship. For his capstone project, he created a company to connect smallholder farmers in distant rural communities with urban markets for organically grown meat.  Today, at Deloitte Southeast Asia, Lumagbas helps some of the largest public companies in the world advance their sustainability and ESG objectives, such as by developing strategies that transform their culture. Previously, he was branch founder and former Philippine president of 180 Degrees Consulting, a consultancy for nonprofits and social enterprises. Lumagbas also cofounded Green Impact Global, his self-described \"passion project\" and winner of the Enactus Action Accelerator Global Award for student entrepreneurs. His initiative connects reforestation and climate mitigation with green financing and local economic development ¡X all efforts that would buffer the types of destruction that Washi wrought. Akshay Makar, 27 Founder and CEO, Climatenza Solar; Delhi, India When most people think about solar, they think about electricity. But for Akshay Makar, that ignores a huge piece of solar energy¡¦s potential to fight climate change. That¡¦s why, after graduating college in 2015 with a mechanical engineering degree, he looked at India¡¦s saturated photovoltaic industry and decided to go in a different direction. \"My vision was to be a part of something that would revolutionize,\" Makar says. That something is Climatenza Solar, the company he founded that is developing solar thermal technology for large-scale clients, including H&M and Nestl? factories. Solar thermal plants capture thermal energy that can be used for hot water or steam, some of the largest energy needs in industrial settings that currently rely on fossil fuels. Makar launched his company in Delhi with the help of governmental and nonprofit grants, and has since expanded to Chile, where solar radiation is abundant and the government is eager to accelerate energy companies through Start-Up Chile, a startup a',\n",
              " 'The 2021 proxy season is officially here ¡X much awaited after the tumultuous events of 2020. From how businesses chose to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic to the escalating outcry over racial justice to the increasing urgency around climate change, there is much for companies to answer for this year.The annual proxy season is also an important harbinger of change in how companies are evolving their governance models and approach to environmental and social issues.So, what are some ESG issues rising to the top for investors this year? And what could that mean for a corresponding evolution in how companies manage, measure and disclose their ESG risks and efforts?Here¡¦s what I found:In one of the most high-profile examples, investment manager Neuberger Berman voted against the Berkshire Hathaway management last week in response to calls for analysis that shows how the conglomerate manages climate risks as well as diversity and inclusion. Global investment firm Federated Hermes also issued an open letter in the week leading up to Berkshire Hathaway¡¦s proxy meeting, urging the company to disclose how it manages physical and transitional climate-related risks and opportunities, including climate-related financial reporting as well as the feasibility of the parent company and its subsidiaries in establishing science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.With the European Union increasingly mandating disclosure on climate action, this is a tactic that increasingly will come handy for investors looking to standardize disclosure on this issue. Despite a dramatic uptick in ESG disclosure, there remains no preferred standard for companies to follow. And while stock market darling Warren Buffett might be able to successfully avert this vote for now, mandatory disclosure is likely coming soon, thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission¡¦s escalated scrutiny of ESG performance and disclosure with its new ESG Taskforce.Regardless, Neuberger is stepping up the pressure on multiple fronts, according to a report by Barron¡¦s, by pre-announcing votes on shareholder proposals for more than 60 companies?this proxy season. That¡¦s almost double compared to 2020. Other companies facing similar pressure this season include?General Motors, facing a shareholder proposal to align its performance on GHG reductions with its executive compensation, as well as ExxonMobil for deeper transparency on its climate change financial risks.ESG teams and committees will be wise to counsel their C-suite on this rising tide with expanded disclosure on their approach to climate change ¡X and corresponding targets.The second area seeing a rush of proposals is diversity and inclusion, specifically asking companies to demonstrate how they are making progress on an issue most have publicly committed to improve in. According to Just Capital, 38 percent of S&P 500 companies had announced some sort of action plan on D&I by?September. While some of these proposals are certainly inspired by the pandemic and the protests following George Floyd¡¦s death, others are being driven by continued pressure from organizations such as CalPERS and the activist nonprofit As You Sow, which also publishes a Racial Justice Scorecard.In fact, Nuveen, investing arm of TIAA, expects more than 40 resolutions centered around releasing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO-1) data or publishing a standalone performance report on diversity and inclusion versus embedding it into their annual sustainability reports. That¡¦s nearly double the 22 resolutions filed last year.Recent examples of such reports include Google, Bristol Myers Squibb?and Dell Technologies. While there is no framework guiding these self-disclosures, companies are reporting their workforce¡¦s gender, ethnicity and generational makeup at the very least, although data on more tenuous issues such as racial equity, turnover, pay equity and diversity hiring practices remains scarce and disparate.One emerging ask: Third-party audits of how companies are working to improve their work on promoting racial equity in the workplace, initiated by CtW Investment earlier this year. While Citi and Goldman Sachs both rejected the proposal, Bloomberg reported from Citi¡¦s annual meeting last month that \"the support was high enough that companies are likely to face increased pressure to agree to future reviews.\"Proposals asking for issues across the ESG spectrum continue to evolve and persist, ensuring they remain firmly in focus for companies year after year. So far, examples include demanding new or expanded disclosure on:Finally, in a bold signal to the industry, Walmart recommended its shareholders to vote against a proposal to withdraw its CEO and chairman¡¦s endorsement of the Business Roundtable¡¦s 2020 Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation in its 2021 Proxy Statement.It noted: \"At Walmart, we think we maximize long-term value for our shareholders by serving our stakeholders. We call this shared value, and it includes delivering value to our customers, creating economic opportunity for associates and suppliers, strengthening local communities and enhancing the environmental and social sustainability of our business and product supply chains.\"Stand by for more.',\n",
              " 'The COVID pandemic, horrific as it¡¦s been, has been reasonably kind to the worlds of sustainable business and climate tech. Both enter 2022 on an upward, even hockey-stick growth trajectory, in large part the result of events and commitments that have taken place since the pandemic began in early 2020.And yet, such progress can be elusive, lost amid the daily drumbeat of disheartening and discouraging news.Indeed, the ingredients for negativity are all too abundant: a persistent, shapeshifting virus; political stalemates that thwart climate action; growing social and economic inequality; pushback by the anti-science crowd and their media enablers. Toss in a dollop of corporate greenwashing, at least according to critics, and you have a recipe for despair.But despair not, dear reader. Our time has finally arrived. The world is coming to us ¡X all of us ¡X seeking guidance and solutions on how, and how quickly, we can transform products, processes, strategies and business models to succeed in an increasingly warming and wobbly world. Climate, biodiversity, plastic waste, toxic pollution and all the other environmental challenges have conjoined with social issues ¡X institutional racism; economic inequity; the lack of clean water, sanitation, affordable food, energy, housing and mobility for far too many of our fellow humans ¡X to put the work of sustainability professionals in the center ring, no longer a mere sideshow.There¡¦s enough progress to turn even the most hardbitten sustainability skeptic optimistic. Things that not long ago seemed an environmentalist\\'s pipe dream ¡X net-zero supply chains! cheap energy storage! decarbonized aviation and shipping! circular value chains! enlightened investors! ¡X now seem not only possible, but inevitable. Climate tech is doing what technology often does: becoming cheaper and more efficient, leveraging economies of scale, network effects, global trends and competitive pressures.But, as I said, it can be hard to see all this progress amid the fog of dismal daily headlines.To help, as I have done each December for more than a decade, I¡¦ve plumbed the 1,400 or so stories, columns and analyses we¡¦ve published on GreenBiz.com since the clock struck 2021 some 12 months ago, seeking signs of progress and hope. These are among the developments that will propel us into 2022 and beyond.Here, in no particular order, are five storylines ¡X and then some ¡X that I found encouraging during the year just ending. (All links are to stories published on GreenBiz.com during 2021.) What would you add to the list? Feel free to weigh in.Suddenly, corporate sustainability folks are spending less time in the shadows and more in the limelight ¡X or, at least, being invited onto the main stage. And the demand for their services has become nearly insatiable. That¡¦s a sea change from the past and has led to an unfamiliar problem: a surfeit of jobs for sustainability professionals but not enough qualified individuals to fill them.The inevitable result: A war for talent, especially for those with experience in ESG data and reporting, although \"ESG\" seems to have become synonymous with \"sustainability\" inside many companies, so it isn¡¦t always easy to grok what a particular job entails. Nonetheless, ESG is rewriting CSO job descriptions at some companies.It¡¦s not just ESG. Circular economy professionals are also in growing demand as that field matures inside companies. And, of course, those experienced in clean energy systems, from implementing efficiency measures to building EV charging networks to rethinking and retooling electricity grids. There are growing opportunities for emerging professionals, those in entry-level positions, consultants, even the formerly incarcerated.Will the demand sustain in 2022? Likely yes. In fact, the opportunities should grow across sectors as more companies take on increasingly bold measures in response to the demands of customers, investors, employees and others. Time to polish your resum?.For years, it was assumed that certain industries ¡X aviation, trans-ocean shipping, manufacturing steel and concrete, and other so-called \"hard-to-abate\" sectors ¡X would be nearly impossible to decarbonize. For example, the idea that a passenger jet could travel without using petroleum seemed ¡X well, a flight of fancy.The past year saw some remarkable advances that may well bring that and other fanciful notions in for a smooth landing.At fall¡¦s G20 and COP26 meetings, nations came together to announce plans to jointly support the development of \"green steel,\" made using hydrogen or renewable energy. Volvo and Mercedes, for example, both embraced low-carbon steel in building vehicles. A clean-steel manufacturing plant opened in Sweden while steelmaking giant ArcelorMittal announced plans to cut its carbon intensity by a quarter, backed by 10 billion investment to support its transition away from fossil fuels.Similar efforts are taking place in concrete, another carbon-intensive material. Carbon-sequestering concrete is gaining attention and investment from startups and investors. California, New Jersey and New York have enacted bills to give procurement preference to low-carbon concrete, a potentially significant demand driver.Meanwhile, development of cleaner aviation and shipping fuels is moving along nicely. A Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificate system was launched to drive corporate demand for jet fuel via the sale and purchase of credits. Amazon funded Infinium, which makes low-carbon biofuel for use in airplanes, ships and large trucks, of which the online retailer has plenty. Boeing launched plans to produce commercial aircraft capable of flying entirely on sustainable aviation fuel. Delta, JetBlue and United all announced billion-dollar investments or commitments to ramp up their use of sustainable fuels. And shipping giant Maersk said it would?purchase eight container vessels that can run on clean methanol instead of dirty bunker fuel.For these sectors, the journey to decarbonization will no doubt be long. But suddenly, those activities no longer seem quite so \"hard to abate.\"With just over half of the 80 trillion global economy reliant on nature¡¦s services, the role of biodiversity became a bottom-line issue. One big reason: As the climate crisis wreaks havoc on some ecosystems, accelerating species extinction, it is threatening food, fiber, fisheries, forests and other critical components of our global economic engine. Moreover, the biodiversity and climate crises are inextricably linked, meaning that solving one can help solve the other. (Consider the transcendent role of the lowly fungus, for example.)Signs of engagement abound. Investors, eyeing the inherent risks, are weighing in, with some institutional investors dropping companies linked to such things as deforestation and overfishing. A UN-sponsored biodiversity summit garnered corporate interest, perhaps for the first time. Governments are seeking to stem biodiversity loss by developing strong environmental legal frameworks and eliminating harmful incentives and subsidies. A new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures aims to help companies report and act on nature-related risks, although putting a monetary value on such risks will be challenging. Still, companies in sectors as varied as food, textiles and cosmetics are taking action. Could becoming \"nature positive\" become the next big thing??Companies have been grappling for years with how to adequately report on environmental, social and governance issues to investors and other interested parties. In 2021, those simmering issues reached a boil. One highlight was the launch of the International Sustainability Standards Board, with the goal of creating comparable, consistent and reliable disclosure standards on climate and other issues.It¡¦s sorely needed. Although the quality is improving, ESG reporting and metrics continue to be a Wild West, with uneven, inconsistent and incomplete data inhibiting consistency across companies, sectors and borders. The rise of greenwash charges among critics is approaching worrisome levels. Indeed, despite its promise, there¡¦s a sense that the whole ESG ecosystem is huge and terribly flawed. Regulators ¡X notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ¡X are eyeing new ESG governance rules, expected early in 2022, incontrovertible evidence that ESG issues are material to mainstream investors.Government intervention notwithstanding, the rise of ESG is changing management strategies, as the C-suite recognizes that reporting these metrics is only the beginning of a continuous-improvement process. ESG scores are beginning to affect companies¡¦ cost of credit, which is garnering the attention of corporate boards, although most still lack ESG expertise.Nonetheless, the die is cast: ESG issues have become part of the new normal, a recognition that corporate sustainability has moved well beyond mere virtue-signaling.You can see it clearly on Google Trends: \"Decarbonization,\" which sputtered along feebly as a search term the past dozen or so years, suddenly surged in 2021. One reason: It¡¦s become a catchall term for myriad initiatives and strategies to wring out the carbon intensity of products, processes and places, from cities to the circular economy (and circular cities).It¡¦s not that decarbonization is a new thing; as Google Trends shows, it had a previous, milder surge of interest in the mid-2000s. But this time decarbonization is more than a trend: It has become the Holy Grail for companies and countries alike.One reason for the term¡¦s popularity is that it encompasses a wide range of front-burner issues, such as the growth of renewable energy, the rise of net-zero commitments, nations¡¦ pledges under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the maturing of carbon removal technologies and markets, and the market uptake of a host of technologies collectively described as climate tech.Whatever the motivation, decarbonization is now part of mainstream discourse. And as it continues to inform everything from industrial processes to construction projects to transportation networks, it has embedded itself in the pantheon of corporate sustainability goals and strategies, and all of the value creation therein.Lots more inspiration where those came from: the growth of technologies to turn down the environmental impacts of cold chains ¡K the ongoing transformation of transportation and mobility systems ¡K investors¡¦ recognition of the links between infrastructure and climate resilience ¡K the tantalizing smorgasbord of sustainable food startups.And if you¡¦re somehow still hungry for more, here, in alphabetical order, are a baker¡¦s dozen of other encouraging corporate sustainability headlines we ran in 2021:I invite you to follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Monday morning newsletter, GreenBuzz, from which this was reprinted, and listen to?GreenBiz 350, my weekly podcast, co-hosted with Heather Clancy.',\n",
              " 'One of the biggest climate tech narratives of 2021 had a lot to do with something I covered very closely in my journalistic past: the enterprise software industry.Therefore, it seems fitting for the year to culminate with announcements related to two trends I¡¦ve been following closely: a deluge of funding for startups developing carbon management applications and the acceleration of corporate commitments for emerging carbon removal technology.?On Tuesday, not-even-a-year-old French startup Sweep disclosed a 22 million Series A round ¡X the biggest yet for the enterprise climate tech software category ¡X led by Europe¡¦s Balderton Capital. The infusion brings its total funding to 27 million.?The deal was disclosed barely six weeks after the monster 101 million Series B round ¡X likewise, a record-breaker ¡X for another software company every corporate carbon manager should have on its radar, Persefoni. Among the many competitive differentiators that this company touts, two really stand out for me: the depth of its management team ¡X which includes former ERM partner Mike Wallace and the past CEO of the Global Reporting Initiative, Tim Mohin ¡X and the company¡¦s plan to offer a free version of its software for small and midsize enterprises. For me, that latter strategy will be key to scaling these carbon management software systems. Smart move.Sweep also has some serious enterprise credentials and expertise on its management team. Its co-founder and CEO, Rachel Delacour, was co-founder of BIME Analytics, a business intelligence application eventually acquired by respected customer support software vendor Zendesk. As a result of the new funding, Bernard Liautaud, another big-wig from the European enterprise software scene, is joining the board. Liautaud was the founder of analytics company Business Objects, the first European software firm to make its initial public offering on Nasdaq back in 1994. (Business Objects was ultimately bought by software powerhouse SAP.)When I spoke with Delacour about the Sweep funding last week, she told me the new money will be used to help almost triple the company¡¦s headcount over the next 12 months including engineering, marketing and sales. (The firm currently employs just over 20 people.) One of Sweep¡¦s biggest competitive differentiators, she believes, is its ability to help large companies gather very granular information across distributed organizations and supply chains. This sort of decentralized access and insight can help companies actually act on reducing emissions, rather than just reporting on them, she told me. \"The closer we are to the emissions, the better the opportunity we have to address it,\" Delacour said.?While she was cagey about Sweep¡¦s customers, one of the named accounts she will talk about is Saint-Gobain, the big construction materials manufacturer.What companies are Sweep¡¦s biggest potential rivals? While most of its sales activity to date has focused on leads in Europe, her firm is most often asked about the Salesforce cloud sustainability management platform, which will get its own competition from Microsoft starting next year. \"I love that,\" she said, pointing to the rapidly maturing market for carbon management software.The other big story I¡¦m following this week is the commitment of 6 million to four new carbon removal projects by Irish-born software company Stripe. The new purchases (the third round under the Stripe Climate initiative that the company launched in 2020) bring the company¡¦s total commitments to 15 million dedicated to helping scale emerging carbon capture and sequestration approaches. The company worked with 13 advisers to help select the solutions for this latest batch, which include:Stripe is the first customer for most of these projects: It¡¦s worth noting it was also the first client for Charm Industrial, which has ?sequestered more than 5,000 tons of carbon in the form of a plant-based oil on behalf of Stripe and other customers including Shopify and Microsoft. And Stripe contributed about 10 percent of the financing for the new Climeworks direct air capture facility in Iceland.?The money in this latest batch of purchases ¡X the company\\'s second round of commitments this year, which represents Stripe\\'s desire to accelerate its involvement ¡X is being paid out in two tranches. Stripe is paying 2 million upfront to help get projects off the ground (or in the ground as the case may be). That amount is equally split among the four companies, according to Nan Ransohoff, head of climate at Stripe, who chatted with me this week about the initiative. The other 4 million will be paid out if and when the technologies meet certain technical milestones.?Ransohoff said those metrics and timelines are different for each project, but they are based on a number of criteria, particularly the permanence of the solution (1,000 years or more);? the physical footprint of the solution (ensuring that it isn\\'t constrained by access to arable land); the potential to reach a cost of less than 100 per ton of removal by 2040; and the ability to reach more than a half-gigaton of carbon sequestration potential annually. \"The things that are risky are diverse, depending on the project,\" she told me.?Of the Stripe project partners required to reach certain milestones to earn a contract renewal (a policy that started with Stripe\\'s second round of purchases), Charm Industrial met its first set of goals early and has received additional funding under Stripe Climate, Ransohoff said.The money in the Stripe Climate fund comes from the company itself and from a program that lets businesses using the Stripe payments service direct a portion of their own revenue toward carbon removal projects ¡X the amount they can choose to contribute is flexible, but Ransohoff said 1 percent is a fairly common commitment.So far, 15,000 companies have contributed to the program under that model, according to Stripe. While their total financial contribution is undisclosed and still relatively small, Ransohoff said interest is growing. The payments company recently included optional enrollment for Stripe Climate as part of its account onboarding. So far, she said 8 percent of new customers have elected to participate under that workflow. \"It is a testament to the fact that we are all waking up to the realization that climate change is happening and there is a latent desire to do something about it,\" Ransohoff said.',\n",
              " '2021 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the electric vehicle. While this is true across weight classes and duty cycles, perhaps none are better positioned for growth than trucks. To be sure, 2020 saw a number of exciting announcements from manufacturers eager to electrify heavy-duty big rigs, semi-trucks, box trucks, delivery vans and additional freight vehicles. And 2021 is primed to take many of these announcements from the planning stages to fruition (as our friends at GreenBiz have covered here). In many ways, 2021 is expected to be the year that electric trucks shift from demonstration to deployment.Some key trends to watch include increasing model availability, growing political momentum in North America, declining costs?and expanded charging infrastructure and utility programs.A top-cited challenge for trucking fleets looking to electrify: Electric trucks have been hard to come by historically, with limited models available. And although it can be hard to define \"production,\" many manufacturers developing and road-testing vehicles are slated to move into commercial production in the near future.Over the next year, in the United States and Canada alone, zero-emissions freight vehicle availability is expected to increase from over 70 models from two dozen manufacturers to at least 85 models from over 30 companies. This includes vehicles from Arrival and Rivian, which made a splash last year after announcing large orders and partnerships with UPS and Amazon, respectively. It also includes the much-anticipated Tesla semi, which has boasted pre-orders from giants such as Walmart, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch, DHL, FedEx, UPS, Sysco, Loblaw and Pride Group Enterprises. Nikola expects to begin production on its Tre battery-electric semi-truck in 2021 as well.But it is not just these newcomers ramping up production of electric trucks. Traditional OEMs are getting in the game too. For example, just last month, Volvo Trucks North America announced that its Class 8 VNR Electric model will begin production in early 2021. Kenworth is also slated to produce its first Class 8 battery-electric truck ¡X the T680E ¡X in 2021. Meanwhile, Peterbilt ¡X which already has begun deliveries of its Model 220EV ¡X is slated to begin production of its new Model 579EV in Q2 and Workhorse is gearing up to start delivery of its C series panel vans in Q3 of this year.Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA), whose president and CEO has publicly stated his belief that \"the future is electric,\" also plans to offer electric models in all its main sales regions by 2022. These models range from the FUSO eCanter in the light-duty segment and the Freightliner eM2 in the medium-duty segment to the Mercedes-Benz eActros and the Freightliner eCascadia in the heavy-duty segment. Daimler also has committed to carbon-neutral production, investing in a combination of energy efficiency and renewable electricity.Finally, GM is getting in the electric delivery game via a new business unit ¡X?BrightDrop?¡X to \"electrify and improve the delivery of goods and services\" via \"an integrated ecosystem of electric products, software and services.\" BrightDrop plans to start delivering its electric EV600 package van to its first customer, FedEx, later this year.Against this backdrop of increased model availability, policymakers at all levels of government are calling for an urgent transition to zero-emissions vehicles. Again, this is true across vehicle classes, although the call to address emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles has seen unprecedented momentum recently as the public health impacts of these vehicles have been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, U.S. policymakers and regulators are realizing the difficulty of achieving their ambitious climate targets without addressing pollution from this sector, which accounts for nearly one-quarter of the country¡¦s transportation greenhouse gas emissions.For example, in June, California¡¦s Air Resources Board (CARB) mandated via its innovative Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) rule that commercial truck manufacturers sell zero-emissions trucks as an increasing percentage of their annual statewide sales. While the rule doesn¡¦t go into effect until 2024, it sends a clear signal to the industry that electric trucks are coming. CARB is also developing a complementary medium- and heavy-duty zero-emissions fleet regulation.In a show of growing political will, the following month, 15 states and the District of Columbia ¡X?a group collectively accounting for nearly 40 percent of goods moved by truck ¡X?signed a \"Multi-State Medium- and Heavy-Duty Zero Emission Vehicle Memorandum of Understanding\" (MOU) (PDF). This MOU commits to develop an action plan to \"support widespread electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\"Facilitated by Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), the MOU includes a goal of 100 percent zero-emissions vehicle sales by mid-century and an interim goal of 30 percent sales by 2030. It also includes a commitment to ensure electric truck deployments \"benefit disadvantaged communities that have been historically burdened with higher levels of air pollution.\" The draft action plan will be released later this year.And states aren¡¦t the only ones moving full steam ahead; cities are also doing their part to accelerate electric truck deployments. For example, last year, Santa Monica, California announced plans for the country¡¦s first zero-emissions delivery zone and New York City launched its Clean Trucks Program. Meanwhile, Chicago developed its Commercial Electric Vehicle Readiness Guidelines to help developers incorporate EV charging readiness for medium- and heavy-duty fleets into projects.2021 may prove to be a big year for federal action as well. President-elect Joe Biden¡¦s climate and \"Made in America\" plans include massive federal support for EVs and their requisite charging infrastructure. And the incoming secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, recently called for putting \"millions of new electric vehicles on America¡¦s roads\" to help meet the climate crisis.With a new climate-friendly administration, both nonprofits and industry are calling for federal action to accelerate this transition to EVs. Perhaps most notable, a group of America¡¦s biggest truck equipment manufacturers, suppliers and key stakeholders formed the National Zero-Emission Truck Coalition and called for a national point-of-sale incentive program to support the production and deployment of zero-emissions trucks. This idea also has been incorporated into the House Select Committee¡¦s Climate Action Plan.California¡¦s ACT rule alone is expected to save the industry 7 billion, reduce emissions by more than 17 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and 60,000 tons of hazardous nitrogen oxides, prevent more than 900 premature deaths and benefit public health to the tune of at least 9 billion over the next 20 years. Considering these broad benefits of truck electrification, political momentum behind supporting and accelerating this transition is expected to continue.The higher initial purchase price of electric trucks also has been identified by fleets as a top barrier. Fortunately, prices are expected to come down as manufacturers scale production. Prices are also expected to decrease along with battery prices, which already have declined 89 percent in the last decade and are expected to continue to fall.For example, BloombergNEF¡¦s annual Battery Price Survey found that lithium-ion battery pack prices fell 13 percent in the last year alone. BNEF anticipates this price will continue to drop on pace to help EVs achieve price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles within the next three years globally. In the meantime, subsidies and incentives will help fill the gap.Finally, utilities are slowly but surely figuring out how to partner with fleets to appropriately build out charging infrastructure to support these electric trucks. Make-ready infrastructure programs ¡X which provide funding for required infrastructure upgrades such as new transformers, conduit, panels and meters ¡X are available in a handful of states. Rate design is also evolving to help ensure that clean electricity is cost-competitive with traditional diesel fuel. And infrastructure engineering, permitting and procurement processes are being developed and streamlined. Meanwhile, issues around high-power charging (required by limited dwell time of vehicles), managed or \"smart\" charging, and interoperability are also being addressed.And while the majority of early electric truck deployments currently rely on private charging infrastructure, plans are being developed to build-out accessible public charging. For example, the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative ¡X a collaboration among electric utilities and agencies representing municipal utilities ¡X proposed a plan to build out charging infrastructure along 1,300 miles of Interstate 5 to support medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks from the Mexican to the Canadian border. And DTNA is partnering with Portland General Electric to open \"Electric Island,\" a large public charging site for medium- and heavy-duty electric commercial vehicles expected to be the first of its kind in the United States.All these trends indicate that 2021 will be a year like no other for electric trucks. But as fleets, OEMS, utilities, charging providers and policymakers strive to shift from demonstrations to large-scale commercial deployments, the importance of leveraging real-world data and insights to address challenges and inform future deployments cannot be overstated.To accelerate progress, the industry will need to glean lessons learned from leaders on the forefront of innovation. They will need to scale best practices while also increasing confidence that ¡X when the rubber meets the road ¡X these vehicles are capable of meeting the rigorous requirements of the freight industry. Most important, the industry will need to come together with stakeholders across the electric truck ecosystem to support innovation, collaboration and the acceleration of zero-emissions goods movement.In response to these needs, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) announced the third in their bi-annual Run on Less trucking demonstration series. This year¡¦s Run on Less will focus on electric trucking, with 10 dedicated trucks and drivers reporting real-time data to show the current state of electric trucking technology in the freight industry.Supported by title sponsors including Dana, Meritor and Shell, the Run on Less-Electric (RoL-E) demonstration vehicles will include electric vans, medium-duty box trucks and heavy-duty trucks moving freight in a variety of conditions and geographic areas. In order to increase electric truck adoption and deployment, RoL-E will help fleets, charging infrastructure companies, utility companies, and policymakers better understand the current benefits and challenges of hauling freight with electric trucks.To complement the RoL-E demonstration and data collection components, RMI and NACFE also will host a series of virtual educational events (E-series) to convene industry stakeholders to discuss the why and how of electric truck deployments. An opportunity to learn from leaders in fleet electrification beyond the formal Run participants, the public E-series will include discussions with fleet managers, charging providers, utilities, engineering firms and policymakers.RMI and NACFE seek applications from fleets interested in participating in the run.

              " \"Despite the numerous environmental obstacles thrown up by the previous administration, many U.S. cities have not only persevered in their efforts to combat climate change but they have made major strides forward, thanks to Bloomberg Philanthropies and its groundbreaking American Cities Climate Challenge?program.Created in 2018, the Climate Challenge, in partnership with NRDC, provided 25 cities with powerful resources to boost their efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Cities account for an overwhelmingly large percentage of global carbon emissions, primarily through transportation and buildings ¡X sectors where mayors can enact real change.Empowered by the Climate Challenge, these 25 cities implemented 54 major transportation, buildings and energy policies and 71 bold climate programs and initiatives ¡X even in the midst of a global pandemic ¡X resulting in substantial gains over just 2.5 years.?In a report that crunched the numbers, here¡¦s what these impressive gains mean in cold, hard data: Collectively, the work of the Climate Challenge across these cities will reduce CO2 emissions by 74 million metric tons (MT) from 2020 through 2030, compared to a business-as-usual scenario. When we took this a step further and evaluated their combined achievements, including action taken outside of the Climate Challenge, we found the cities are on track to collectively reduce emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, which will beat the 2025 Paris Agreement goal of a 26 to 28 percent reduction.Since transportation generates a significant share of emissions in the United States at 29 percent, Climate Challenge cities made cutting these emissions a priority. To date, they¡¦ve approved 31 policies and launched 41 programs that have incentivized low-carbon transit, increased vehicle electrification and changed the face of their streets ¡X with 510 miles of new or improved bike lanes and 75 miles of pedestrian-friendly walkways.To reduce traffic congestion and the emissions that it produces, multiple cities raised new revenue for mass transit to help residents move around without getting into their cars. San Antonio¡¦s innovative Proposition A reallocates one-eighth of every cent of an already existing sales tax to fund nearly 40 million toward cleaner, more efficient public transit. Hamilton County voters in Cincinnati passed Issue 7 to add eight new bus routes and provide 24-hour service in seven major corridors. Overall, Climate Challenge cities added or enhanced 37 miles of bus lanes, among other transit projects. And half a dozen cities launched affordable car-sharing initiatives as an alternative to car ownership.Moreover, it¡¦s clear that the future of transportation is electric, so with that in mind, several cities implemented electric vehicle (EV) readiness ordinances, accelerated electrification in municipal fleets for a total of 1,136 new EV buses and cars, and installed 14,143 new EV chargers. Many cities plan to convert to fully EV fleets in the coming years.Commercial and residential buildings, together with the electricity generated from fossil fuel sources, account for a whopping 38 percent?of CO2 emissions in the United States. Climate Challenge cities tackled these interconnected sectors by focusing on increasing energy efficiency and sourcing renewable energy. In total, the cities passed 23 policies and launched 30 programs in the buildings and energy sectors.More than 37,000 energy audits were conducted to assess current usage and efficiency in buildings. Several cities instituted benchmarking policies ¡X covering nearly 400 million square feet of real estate ¡X in concert with building performance standards that set targets for increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions progressively, over time.Nearly half of the cities were able to obtain clean energy sources to power their buildings, with more than 800 megawatts of renewable energy under contract or pending. In New Mexico, the partnership between a soon-to-be-built solar farm on the Jicarilla Apache Nation reservation and the city of Albuquerque will raise the city¡¦s renewable energy usage to an estimated 65 percent. To ensure sustainability into the future, three cities passed reach codes (standards for energy savings beyond current state requirements) that incorporate EV charging, solar and other renewable energy readiness into new-construction buildings.A citywide climate plan can¡¦t be comprehensive without also addressing the needs of underserved communities, which often bear the brunt of polluting industry and have less access to public transit and clean energy options.Multiple Climate Challenge cities expanded or added bus routes to better serve these vulnerable communities. Some cities with car-sharing programs made sure to install EV charging stations in underserved neighborhoods and/or offer pricing incentives for seniors and low-income residents to access car-sharing options.Cincinnati¡¦s WarmUp Cincy program assisted low-income tenants with in-unit energy equipment upgrades to reduce emissions in rental buildings. And in partnership with the Climate Challenge and the city of Orlando, Florida, the Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) empowers underserved homeowners to afford solar and other energy-efficient home improvements to amplify the city¡¦s overall resilience against climate change.To help build more robust, equitable economies, a handful of Climate Challenge cities and their partners introduced green workforce-development programs as part of their clean energy requirements. More than 800 residents so far have been trained or upskilled to work in high-road clean energy jobs. And, if approved by Congress, President Joe Biden¡¦s Build Back Better Agenda will further bolster these efforts toward an equitable economic recovery for the country.?As the Climate Challenge has demonstrated, cities can have an outsize impact on climate change and improve people¡¦s lives in a substantive way. With a new administration that¡¦s committed to combating the crisis, federal and state governments can draw on the leading-edge policies and programs that have been test-driven at the local level. And the 25 pioneering cities that embarked on the Climate Challenge will continue to demonstrate how cities can be leaders and drive momentum at all levels of climate action.This post originally appeared on NRDC's Expert Blog.\",\n",
              " 'Much has been written about how our environment will benefit from the current COVID-19 crisis ¡X the world is witnessing the power of mass behavior change, brands are remembering the importance of leading with purpose and Mother Nature is getting a few months to recover. While I believe these lessons are valuable, realizing a fully sustainable and circular economy remains an uphill battle.?Many soldiers must be enlisted in this fight, including the private sector. These companies, large and small, have the responsibility to reimagine their products and operations and share compelling stories with customers that change behaviors. As any sustainability marketer can attest to, this is easy to say, but much harder to do in practice ¡X sustainability is a fundamentally complex issue to explain. We must get past these communication challenges, however, if we want to successfully build on the momentum gained by our current global health crisis and advance the environmental movement forward.?To help brands ¡X which are so critical to this fight ¡X better communicate their sustainability commitments, my company, QuickFrame, researched what made for effective marketing in regards to the environment.?We used our machine learning-powered content analytics tool to analyze the recent video output of the 100 most sustainable corporations ranked by Corporate Knights, uncovering data-driven strategies that most successfully captivate viewers. Our research revealed which brands got it right and why. Let¡¦s take a look at three examples.??Over the last several years, H&M has spent more time highlighting its \"Conscious Collection,\" which comprises products that contain at least 50 percent sustainable materials.?During a campaign for its fall edition in 2019, one of the global retailer¡¦s most popular content pieces was a short video that highlighted the positive side of durable, re-wearable clothing made from recycled PET bottles.?Many brands would have fallen into the temptation to go negative and highlight our plastic pollution problem so they could then explain they were part of the solution. Our research reveals, however, that videos positively depicting nature¡¦s beauty and innovative climate change solutions were 50 times more effective at driving views than negative messaging or even a combination of positive and negative.Climate change affects the entire world, yet many immediate threats feel distant to a brand¡¦s viewers, thus creating a perceived gap between the climate issue at large and problems that impact us day-to-day.?QuickFrame¡¦s analysis uncovered that brands that successfully bridged this gap did so via shots of recognizable locales. Images of cities and oceans, both of which are relatable to the average human, heavily outperformed their more distant counterparts such as glaciers and power plants.?In December, Google released a video about its Environmental Insights Explore tool and chose a creative approach that discussed how the technology was helping cities such as Dublin, Mexico City and Melbourne design solutions for sustainable transportation, building emissions and solar power.?By keeping the visuals focused exclusively on cities, Google was able to show off the product while making sustainability feel more relevant to viewers. Remember, the more realistic and approachable the settings are, the more likely consumers will be to tune in.?Unilever recently launched Growing Roots, a snack brand that donates 50 percent of its profits to urban farms. While Unilever could have launched this new venture with a communications campaign laden with statistics about agriculture, food inequality and urban sustainability, it chose to highlight the initiative as part of its \"FutureMaker\" series, which focuses on the stories behind the movements improving our planet.?Statistics are an incredibly important part of understanding the environment: They communicate changes in sea level and reductions in emissions, freshwater usage and other important factors impacting the world¡¦s climate.?But while these elements are relevant for sustainability professionals, they leave customers lost ¡X marketing is about emotional storytelling, after all.Our analysis revealed that videos with statistics (\"30 percent emissions reduction\") had six times fewer views than those that were purely narrative. Though sustainability marketers may want to highlight quantifiable plans to build their credibility, communications will be more effective when they reach the heart, not just the head, as this Unilever example demonstrates.The private sector plays a critical role in the fight to meet emissions reductions targets needed to avoid the worst environmental effects. The lion¡¦s share of this effort requires setting ambitious goals and clear pathways toward achieving them. However, effectively sharing these strategies and the progress being made with audiences is an equally important part of the equation.?If brands can change consumer behavior around which products they choose to buy, they will positively change consumer attitudes toward the environment. As a result, the environmental movement will continue to gain the momentum needed to protect our planet and our way of life.',\n",
              " 'I¡¦m going to try to make sense of this tumultuous year, starting with three trends from the past 12 months that I see as key to the immediate future of food.The trend: By Dec. 1, venture capitalists invested a whopping 1.5 billion in alternative proteins during 2020, according to the latest data from the Good Food Institute. That money ¡X close to double the 2019 total ¡X is making the industry increasingly visible. At the start of the year, the Impossible Burger was available in around 150 stores ¡X now you can find it in more than 15,000. Newer alt proteins are also coming. Just last week, Singapore became the first country to approve the sale of lab-grown meat. And while the field may not need further incentives, it got one anyway: This week, the XPRIZE Foundation announced a new 15 million competition focused on chicken and fish alternatives.?The twist: Moving fast means breaking things. I see two bumps in the road. First, alternatives have a tiny market share because animal meat is cheap and, for now, tastes better. Consumption of animal products should and will decrease, but many alt protein brands and startups will disappear before that happens. The second challenge was summed up by the French ag minister¡¦s response to the news from Singapore: ¡§Meat comes from life, not from laboratories. Count on me so that in France, meat remains natural and never artificial!¡¨ I¡¦d bet on seeing more of a backlash against alt proteins. The question is whether it will dent the industry¡¦s trajectory.My take: The minister should visit a concentrated animal feeding operation and explain why he describes what happens there as \"natural.\"The trend: Where do we start? How about June, when Unilever committed to zeroing-out emissions from all its products by 2039? Or last week, when Nestl?, the world¡¦s largest food company, said it would spend?3.6 billion over the next five years as it moves toward a 2050 net-zero target??Or back in March at Horizon Organic, a U.S. dairy brand that committed to going carbon-negative by 2025? Those are just the first three that come to mind in a bumper year for target-setting.The twist: What¡¦s the rest of the industry doing? Far less, in many cases. When experts at CDP, a nonprofit that tracks sustainability commitments, surveyed 479 food and ag companies, only 75 reported having emissions commitments in line with the Paris Agreement. The situation is worse for deforestation. Around half of companies that source soy told CDP that they can track their purchases to the country of origin and no further. This means that when it comes to Brazil and other forest nations, most food companies are blind as to whether their soy comes from newly cleared land.My take: I¡¦m going for glass half-full, at least on emissions. The industry is way behind where it should be, but every company that sets a meaningful target heaps a little more pressure on those that haven¡¦t.The trend: Another area where a flood of new initiatives in 2020 made it challenging to keep up. Big industry names such as Bayer and Cargill said they would help farmers transition to regenerative methods, and big names from the wider corporate world ¡X JPMorgan Chase and IBM, for instance ¡X bought some of the first carbon credits from Indigo Carbon, an soil offsets marketplace. Nori, an Indigo competitor, closed a 4 million funding round. Another disruptive company, Farmers Business Network, launched a service designed to help farmers earn a premium from regeneratively farmed grain. Again, those are just the first examples that come to mind.The twist: No one disputes that these efforts will be good for soil health. But do regenerative methods sequester as much carbon as advocates claim? Some prominent experts think not. In May, the World Resources Institute warned of regenerative ag¡¦s \"limited potential to mitigate climate change.\" If so, should we be building an offsets market around soil credits? Again, experts have doubts: One important step toward such a market, the creation of a protocol for soil carbon offsets, was the subject of multi-pronged criticism.My take: If I¡¦m honest, this worries the hell out of me. Imagine the PR storm if a big company shrinks its carbon footprint using credits that later come under attack in the media. The ensuing controversy could do huge damage to efforts to pay farmers to store carbon in soils.That¡¦s it for part one of my 2020 roundup. Look for more of my reflections (and maybe some predictions) before the end of December.?This article was adapted from the GreenBiz Food Weekly newsletter.

              " 'As the year comes to a (welcome) close, it¡¦s worth taking a moment to consider how the circular economy concept has emerged and evolved during this very particular year. Here are three trends that defined the circular economy in 2020, and what they might mean for the year to come.?1. Reuse is on the rise. Despite some setbacks posed by the pandemic (including misinformation about the safety of reusables peddled by industry lobbying groups), the transition from single-use to reusable packaging is building real momentum. With such proof points as Loop¡¦s continued growth and recent 25 million Series A, Algramo¡¦s New York expansion and the launch of the Beyond the Bag initiative, to name a few, it¡¦s clear that reuse is taking hold at scale.?In 2021, I¡¦ll be watching CPG and food and beverage companies, which have been scrutinized for one-off pilots and an overall failure to move quickly enough towards commitments to make all packaging recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025.If brands and retailers intend to fulfill their public commitments, we¡¦ll need to see real investment in reuse platforms and systems in the year ahead.?2. Metrics begin to materialize. This year saw the launch of new tools and standards to calculate and track the circular nature of products, business and systems.Notably, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development released the Circular Transition Indicators and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched the Circulytics tool; GRI established a new standard on waste; and the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute released the fourth version of its product standard.The bright and shiny narrative of the circular economy¡¦s promise will lose its luster without verified data and material evidence to show that circular is indeed better, and these tools are a step in the right direction.?Next year, I expect to see an emphasis on reporting and consistency of data behind various claims, as well as an effort to fold circular economy metrics into existing sustainability and ESG frameworks.I also will be looking for more actionable datasets and analysis on the link between climate change and the circular economy, and opportunities to mitigate carbon emissions using circular economy strategies.?3. It¡¦s (still) all about plastic. Plastic continues to be the star of the show when it comes to the global conversation about materials management and circular economy solutions.The topic is top of mind for most of us given the increased demand for single-use everything amid the pandemic, which has led to a surge in plastic waste entering into waterways and oceans. But this year also offered a collective leveling-up of our data-backed knowledge and understanding about the flows and intervention points that could stem the tide on plastic pollution.?While source reduction continues to be the No. 1 solution to the global plastic waste crisis, many companies continue to solely address end-of-life management ¡X notably in chemical recycling technologies for plastics packaging and synthetic textiles.?2021 is sure to bring continued tension between the problem of plastic waste and the problem of plastic production and use. I¡¦ll be keeping my eye on the policy landscape and the balance between upstream action and accountability alongside downstream solutions. ',\n",
              " 'Communities across the Global South are facing a hunger crisis ¡X one that existed before COVID-19 hit and has gotten worse. In Southern Africa, record-breaking droughts and floods destroyed crops on a large scale early this year. Meanwhile, massive outbreaks of desert locusts?¡X which can eat as much food as 35,000 people per each square kilometer swarm ¡X continue to threaten crops in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, India and other areas of Africa and Southwest Asia. Now, the economic fallout from COVID-19 could lead to 265 million people facing acute food insecurity in 2020, nearly double that of 2019.The situation is a devastating reminder that the climate crisis is here, and the world¡¦s most vulnerable communities face the worst impacts. Often, these people are farmers. More than two-thirds of people living in poverty rely on agriculture for at least part of their income, if not all of it. Women face disproportionate impacts: they comprise over 40 percent of the agricultural workforce, yet existing institutional biases often prevent them from having access to land rights and climate-smart agricultural solutions. If women had access to the same rights and resources as men, they could increase yields on their farms by 20 to 30 percent on average, and help reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12 to 17 percent.Additionally, climate change could depress global crop yields up to 30 percent by 2050, putting about 50 million more people at risk of undernourishment, according to a paper by the International Food Policy Research Institute produced for the Global Commission on Adaptation. The global food system is under threat, and what we do now will determine whether millions more people go hungry.The Global Commission¡¦s report, Adapt Now, calls on national governments, development agencies and the private sector to support smallholder farmers in adapting to climate change. Globally, around 500 million farms are 4.9 acres or smaller. Smallholder farmers depend on these farms for sustenance and their livelihoods, especially in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. As climate change intensifies and food production decreases, these farmers, many of whom are food insecure and living in poverty, will face even greater challenges.A range of immediate solutions is needed to address these challenges. One that would have significant long-term impact is boosting research and development (R&D) for new crops and agricultural practices resilient to climate impacts such as heat, drought and new disease patterns, making it a key recommendation from the commission.Many research organizations, government agencies and farmers are already developing new climate-resilient technologies and practices. Here are three of the most impactful R&D successes from the past few years that are helping smallholder farmers cope with climate change and bolster food security:Maize is one of the most important crops in Africa, supporting the sustenance and livelihoods of over 300 million people. Maize is also at severe risk due to climate change. Droughts and temperature increases could reduce global maize yields up to 30 percent by 2030, according to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).To address this, CIMMYT undertook major R&D programs to develop drought-tolerant maize varieties with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa program successfully developed hundreds of new varieties that boost farmers¡¦ yields and incomes, directly improving millions of lives.For example, farmers in Zimbabwe who used drought-tolerant maize in dry years harvested up to 1,300 pounds more per 2.47 acres ¡X a surplus worth 240 and enough to feed a family of six for nine months. The success of improved maize varieties in Africa provides a model for developing climate-resilient maize in other vulnerable regions and improving less researched crops such as beans, plantains and potatoes.Lentils are another important crop. In addition to benefiting human and animal health with high protein, carbohydrate and calorie content, lentils improve soil fertility by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which enhances productivity. However, higher temperatures are hurting productivity and yield. This can lead to food security challenges, given that grain legumes alone contribute 33 percent of the protein people consume worldwide.The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) developed an improved lentil variety that produces more lentils than traditional varieties. This new variety can more than double harvests to 1.98 tons per 2.47 acres in under three months ¡X compared to 0.85 tons per 2.47 acres with traditional varieties ¡X and allows farmers to grow lentils in rice fields between growing seasons. This helps smallholder farmers diversify their incomes and nutrition sources, which is vital as climate change threatens other crops.Climate change has multiple effects on aquaculture: droughts evaporate ponds; heat waves reduce oxygen in the water, sickening or killing fish; and sea level rise and flash floods contaminate and destroy ponds. All these impacts reduce fish populations, which in turn harms people who rely on fish for food and employment.Fish provide about 3.2 billion people with a fifth of their animal protein, and fisheries and aquaculture employ up to?10 percent of the world¡¦s population. Women account for about half of the workforce in small-scale fisheries and aquaculture, making these sectors a vital source of income and empowerment for millions of women. Aquaculture is also a critical source of protein and micronutrients (vitamin A, iron and zinc) for undernourished children and pregnant women.Aerators can prevent some of the most prevalent harmful impacts to fish by supplying ponds with dissolved oxygen, keeping more fish alive. While traditional aerators require electricity, often making them unaffordable to small-scale fish farmers, researchers at the University of Toronto recently developed a low-cost aerator that uses heat from the sun. This new aerator also can be manufactured and maintained locally with readily available parts. The technology, tested in Bangladesh through a collaboration between BRAC University and USAID, could help fish farmers earn up to 250 of extra income each year?¡X a meaningful difference for many families.These approaches alone are not enough to tackle the complex challenges that climate change poses for smallholder farmers. That is why a diverse set of approaches, one that includes agroecology, is critical to increasing the resilience of smallholder farmers. Agroecology involves applying ecological, economic and social principles to agriculture. A paper commissioned by the Global Commission on Adaptation highlights that \"locally appropriate agroecological practices clearly have potential to increase the resilience of livelihoods and enhance adaptation to climate change.\"Agroecology is another area in which R&D investment can create a lasting impact for smallholder farmers. It can help illuminate how changes in ecosystems caused by climate change can affect agricultural productivity ¡X for example, by altering pest and disease patterns or the availability of pollinators.These success stories show the benefits that effective R&D investments can have for smallholder farmers and their communities. Despite this impact, however, government spending on agricultural R&D and aid to developing countries is declining.In addition to reducing chronic food insecurity, investing in R&D for climate-resilient crops and technologies is a savvy economic decision for governments. Studies find that the return on investment (PDF) for these technologies is at least 22 percent and can be 62 percent or higher. Analysis by the Global Commission on Adaptation found that investing in improved dryland agriculture crop production over the next 10 years could yield 700 billion in net benefits.The commission is calling for a global mobilization over the coming decade to ensure small-scale food producers are resilient to climate change. Through its Agriculture and Food Security Action Track, the commission is working with dozens of partners to mobilize funding for climate-resilient R&D.But mobilizing funding is not enough. It is vital that research programs, both national and global, are driven by the needs of farmers themselves, including women. That¡¦s why the commission, in partnership with the CGIAR, is hosting listening sessions with stakeholders, such as farmers¡¦ associations; women¡¦s, youth and civil society organizations; national and subnational research entities; and the private sector to develop the Two Degree Initiative. This demand-led research program focuses on the specific needs of eight geographic and thematic hotspots, helping 200 million small-scale food producers across the globe adapt their farming systems, livelihoods and landscapes by 2030 to weather the impacts of climate changes.Governments, civil society organizations and the private sector must consider the importance of climate-resilient agriculture R&D, alongside a diverse set of approaches, in stabilizing the global food system. They also must invest in programs to get these innovations to farmers and build their capacity to use them, particularly in Africa. R&D has been and will remain essential to building resilience and achieving food security during the climate crisis.',\n",
              " 'Several Colorado developers are forgoing fossil fuels and building all-electric, affordable housing units. These developers view all-electric as an attractive option for both new developments and retrofits due to the positive climate impact and cost saving potential, demonstrating the feasibility of the technology even in a colder climate.All-electric housing can help improve indoor air quality and lower asthma rates by eliminating gas appliances, as well as increase equity by giving tenants access to clean, efficient technologies at low costs. As one developer told RMI, the beauty of all-electric is in \"its simplicity\" ¡X it is easy to maintain with high-quality technology that can last longer than gas alternatives.Property developments that take place either on new plots of land or older properties often lack gas connections (requiring new infrastructure investments) or have inherited outdated mechanical systems that have missed critical upgrade cycles. Thus, electrification emerges as an attractive option given its ease of installation and future payoffs in the form of efficiency gains and energy savings.The RMI team spoke with Aaron Martinez of the Urban Land Conservancy and Ian Swallow, representing both Boulder County Housing Authority and Boulder Housing Partners, about these zero-emissions affordable housing projects. The three projects highlighted below show how these Colorado developers are paving the way for future affordable housing that is modern, healthy and climate-friendly.In 2018, the Urban Land Conservancy (ULC) acquired the 31-acre, 150,000-square foot Oxford Vista campus in Aurora, Colorado. The compound was built in 1968 as a single-story school, and ULC aimed to preserve the existing property and convert it into affordable student housing for over 250 tenants attending the Aurora Campus.To ensure affordability, resilience and fulfill its climate goals, the developer chose to retrofit the campus without fossil fuels. Due to the building\\'s age, the mechanical systems were still in their original condition and had missed several upgrade cycles, requiring new wiring and gas line installations. Although there was a slightly higher upfront cost with the all-electric system in weighing the cost to re-install gas lines compared to going all-electric, it proved to be a worthwhile investment. There are fewer maintenance requirements with more efficient heating and cooling, plus lower monthly utility bills for the tenant.The Oxford Vista project provided an opportunity to adopt cutting-edge heating and cooling systems such as a geothermal variable refrigerant volume (VRV) system, 440 kW solar panel array, energy efficient windows and LED Lighting. As a result, the campus uses almost 92 percent less electricity than the national average per square foot. Ground source heat pumps have replaced gas connections and enabled an estimated 20,000 in gas savings, 40,000 in electricity savings and 15,000 in maintenance savings overall. The modern, efficient systems resulted in lower utility bills, enabling more funding to be used for direct service programs.In 2013, Boulder County purchased the 13-acre Kestrel property in Louisville, Colorado. The county used the development as an opportunity to transform this once dilapidated property into a \"100-year, forward-thinking design\" that would ensure not only sustainability, but also longevity. Kestrel offers affordable rental housing with 71 apartments for seniors and 129 townhomes for families of all ages. These homes are available to those whose income does not exceed 60 percent of Boulder County¡¦s area median income and rents are offered below market rates.Because the land was previously undeveloped, the Boulder County Housing Authority opted for a high efficiency geothermal heating and cooling system, along with mini-split heat pumps throughout the complex. The upfront costs of installing the geothermal system were balanced by the savings from avoiding gas infrastructure throughout the entire property, and result in reduced energy costs for the housing authority, which covers tenant utility bills at Kestrel.Boulder Housing Partners (BHP) created the all-electric 30 Pearl Street complex in line with Boulder¡¦s goals to develop more affordable housing. The development occupies the site of an old auto dealership and features 120 units serving individuals and families earning 30 to 60 percent of the area median income. These homes operate without fossil fuels. Constructing all-electric housing is in line with BHP¡¦s mission of sustainability and simplifies construction and operation of the housing complex by avoiding gas lines and gas HVAC equipment, along with the maintenance and safety concerns associated with it.The all-electric design minimized venting requirements from the buildings, boosting efficiency and helping to lower energy bills. A second developer is constructing market rate housing on the same site, also building without gas. This property is near Boulder Junction, a major regional transit hub, creating easy and sustainable access to transit throughout the Denver metro area.* * *Developers of affordable housing are pursuing all-electric designs more frequently because of the climate impact, simplicity and avoided costs of building without gas, and numerous other benefits to residents. BHP indicated they don¡¦t expect to build a new property with fossil fuels ever again. As communities continue to increase ambition to combat climate change, the importance of eliminating fossil fuels will become more apparent. Housing authorities and governments can prioritize all-electric affordable housing to ensure that low- and moderate-income families are among the first to benefit from the improved air quality and comfort these systems provide compared to gas.In Colorado, the legislature has set firm goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And as the electricity mix becomes cleaner, more policies are being debated in the state house to cut emissions from the building sector, with a focus on phasing out natural gas. Affordable housing developers are leading by example with properties such as Oxford Vista, Kestrel, and 30Pearl.Cities such as Denver, which recently announced its Net Zero Implementation Plan, are also recognizing the need for all-electric buildings to support their ambitious climate targets and aiming to support these types of developments with enhanced incentives. As the cost of electric appliances continue to come down and awareness of benefits rises, we expect more developers to choose to build all-electric, affordable housing ¡X for health, for the climate, for simplicity?and for the raw cost advantage.',\n",
              " 'If the fossil fuel-centered, \"take, make, waste\" economies of the last century are truly becoming pass?, what shape should a circular workforce take? Natural capital has been front and center in much of the early evangelism around the circular economy, but a focus on human capital is beginning to emerge.One of the leaders in these discussions is the think tank Circle Economy, which recently issued a vision for what the circular economy can mean in a best-case scenario for people¡¦s labor and livelihoods. The Amsterdam-based social enterprise began several years ago to explore more of the social angle of circularity, knowing that two magic words, \"job creation,\" tend to turn heads.Its latest report, \"Jobs & Skills in the Circular Economy,\" came out in March just as the coronavirus was making its stamp on the western hemisphere. The report originally was planned to kick off a Circular Jobs Initiative with events in Amsterdam, New York City and Brussels. It turns out that this progressive vision for creating circular-economy jobs looks even more urgent and relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic whiplash.\"Human labor ¡X work ¡X is different from the other renewable resources: creative, versatile and adaptable and able to be educated, but perishable if unused,\" said the report, which was produced following conversations with 60 public and private organizations in Europe, North America and Africa.How big is the opportunity for circular jobs? Some wildly ambitious, multi-trillion-dollar projections that made headlines several years ago have been picked apart for failing to take into account the increasing automation of labor as well as import and export flows. The European Commission has projected a somewhat modest .5 percent rise in circular jobs by 2030, which Circle Economy tends to side with.\"We can¡¦t shoot ourselves in the foot, saying the circular economy will create jobs, and that¡¦s the end of it,\" said Joke Dufourmont, lead of the circular jobs Initiative at Circle Economy and co-author of the report. \"There¡¦s tremendous potential in the labor market but we have to steer toward it.\"\\nDeveloping that ecosystem is a huge talent management exercise. And if a circular boom with a global net gain in jobs isn\\'t quite realistic, then high-quality work conditions and prospects are crucial. As Circle Economy fine-tunes what it looks like to design for the future, eliminate waste and rethink old business models, it maintains that business needs to view human labor as a resource rather than a cost, no longer excluding marginalized and at-risk workers.Circle Economy breaks down circular jobs into three categories: \"core\" circular jobs include work in renewable energy; waste and repair; and managing resources. These include repair technicians, agronomic advisors and materials process operators. The \"enabling\" jobs provide a supportive layer that helps to accelerate the core jobs, such as equipment engineers, building information managers and procurement professionals. Finally, \"indirect\" roles include work in education, logistics and the public sector, including teaching and delivery services.Circle Economy calls for an emerging circular labor market to drive growth in these three areas, with help from policy, trade unions and business. Here\\'s what it\\'s advocating for:Circular job training and education is needed to \"skill and reskill\" the workforce, with access for all. ?A mindset shift must reward the fields and occupations that help to preserve natural resources, upending conventions and blurring the lines between so-called skilled and unskilled labor. \"Soft skills for collaborating across sectors and service-related skills will be just as important as hard skills for programming, operating and repairing equipment,\" the report said.Dufourmont added that crises related to sweeping forces such as climate change, including the COVID-19 pandemic, make it especially necessary for companies to ensure adaptability and resilience.\"When facing a crisis you need to be able in an agile way to reorient your workforce,\" she said. \"If that workforce has been trained to build one type of linear career path that¡¦s going to cause a lot of difficulty. Developing that ecosystem is a huge talent management exercise.\" Just because work is circular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s better. All of that means that learning has to become more of a circular than linear process. Education needs to be seen as a lifelong pursuit that enables an individual to evolve over time instead of preparing for one narrow career track. Companies need to invest in education for workers, assisting with ongoing trainings that keep skills fresh. Skill gaps need to be identified in fast-changing fields. Circular knowledge needs to be shared more widely beyond forward-thinking research groups, companies and cities.Circular jobs must be of high quality and safe, with fair pay and employment security. People must think beyond the muscular \"dirty\" work that\\'s often stigmatized, such as sorting recyclables by hand.?Currently, protections for workers are inadequate ¡X and not just within the high-hazard economies teeming in the trash heaps or construction sites of the developing world. It\\'s also about the utter lack of consistent income and protections inherent in the gig economy. These \"platform workers\" may be enabled by high-gloss digital technology, but they barely benefit from it.Ideally, any kind of work should pay well, be safe and offer ongoing development for the person doing it. Companies must better value human capital and ingenuity, and allow for collective bargaining. Understanding workers¡¦ experiences is critical, looking first at both the less-regulated and the nascent sectors.Finally, employers need to embrace circular, systems thinking, \"from leadership to the workshop floor, so as to inspire workers with the role they play in the wider regenerative economy,\" the report said. \"Together with fair pay and working conditions, this should help to increase job satisfaction of workers in the circular economy.\"An \"inclusive labor market\" must offer opportunities for all regardless of levels of skill, including those whose specialties risk becoming obsolete. Gender, ethnicity, immigration status, ability level and location should not determine who enjoys rewarding work. Success for white-collar information workers won\\'t trickle down to others without a concerted effort among businesses and policymakers.And just because work is circular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s better. The many blind spots in globalized supply chains make it hard to understand how materials flows, including waste, affect people around the planet. In addition, leaving underserved communities out of the conversation also threatens to turn them off to the positive possibilities of a circular transition. What\\'s important is that there are more opportunities on the other side they can win from, but it¡¦s about installing these just transitions. There¡¦s no one-size-fits-all approach to a circular transformation for the workforce, which must be examined locally and with education and social protections in mind. Special attention must be paid to the impacts of technology so that it doesn¡¦t worsen the gap between workers of different skill levels.What does inclusion look like? Circle Economy has pointed to cities embracing circular employment (and it is working on a circular transition tool for cities). For example, a Waste-to-Wealth program in Baltimore i s baking deconstruction into building demolition contracts, providing new job opportunities. The city works with the Urban Transitions Alliance to transition from its industrial legacy.This is an excerpt from a Circularity 19 panel discussion about power, privilege and bias in the circular economy. Watch the entire conversation here.)As demand rises for labor in waste management and reverse logistics, repair and maintenance-related work also will grow, Dufourmont said. Yet it¡¦s important to consider that when demand increases for repaired products instead of new ones, or for recycled feedstocks over virgin materials, former suppliers will lose out ¡X just as coal workers are being left behind as renewable energy expands.?\"What¡¦s important is that there are more opportunities on the other side they can win from, but it¡¦s about installing these just transitions,\" she said.To ensure more positive change, therefore, people need to better understand how circularity is emerging economically in different countries, helping to prevent unintended consequences. Those in charge also must look toward frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 8 around promoting \"sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\"Intelligent policy is key, as is building partnerships among stakeholders and providing incentives to companies \"to design products for multiple lifecycles.\"In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, now would appear to be the time to build up an adaptable, safe and motivated circular workforce that operates within more resilient systems, including supply chains.For instance, the risks of the informal gig economy have become more obvious to hundreds of millions of housebound Americans. If grocery store clerks, farmworkers and delivery drivers are deemed essential workers, why do so few of them enjoy job security or health insurance?The possibilities also appear for a throwaway culture to embrace creative ecosystems of repair and reuse. With ventilators in short supply, for instance, independent inventors have shared open source designs for ad hoc ones and have 3D printed some missing pieces.The novel coronavirus crisis has laid bare some gaping holes in globalized supply chains, as hospitals lack personal protective equipment and grocery shelves are bereft of toilet paper and pasta. Looking to further future disruptions, Dufourmont believes that many circular jobs will be locally focused. If nurses and doctors in the United States can\\'t obtain adequate masks or ventilators, partly because of distribution bottlenecks from overseas suppliers, why not reshore more factories closer to consumers?\"There is a potential for the circular economy to keep our society healthy in these types of crises,\" Dufourmont said.',\n",
              " \"For years, city governments in the United States have taken the lead on committing to climate action, with more than 165 cities aiming for 100 percent community-wide clean energy. But whether ambitious goals translate to ambitious action is another question altogether, and unfortunately we¡¦ve seen cities fall short of their commitments before.More recently, many cities also have made or intensified commitments to addressing longstanding structural racism. The movements for racial justice and for environmental sustainability are inextricably linked, as communities of color are disproportionately affected by climate change and have not always benefited from climate and clean energy programs.But as local governments work to center racial justice in planning and services, they need to further both social equity and environmental sustainability.Environmental sustainability without social equity isn¡¦t sustainable, so authentic inclusiveness must be at the heart of local government planning processes. To avoid the stumbles of the past, governments can best lead through collaboration with frontline communities. At the very least, this means letting the community lead, measuring what matters and implementing programs inclusively.Centering equity in city sustainability programs is a welcome development, but it may be easier said than done. Time after time, sustainability programs have tripped over historical injustices and sometimes made inequity worse.Here are a few potential hurdles, created by the way governments historically have done their work, to keep in mind when developing or implementing a clean energy or sustainability program:1. Planning?ignores or misunderstands historical racial contextsIn 2014, a program to offer free street trees to Detroit residents fell far short of expectations when about a quarter of eligible residents declined the offer. Why? Many residents distrusted the government, based on community memories of urban forestry actions from decades earlier that residents took to be racially motivated. To build trust, officials made fundamental changes to the tree-planting program, hiring local citizens as engagement coordinators and involving residents substantively in the planning process.Government officials and processes often tend to favor technocratic approaches ¡X wherein activities of government to identify problems and design solutions is controlled primarily by an elite of technical experts. Tree-planting is a technocrat¡¦s dream: a single intervention can mitigate urban heat islands, improve air quality, reduce noise pollution and raise property values. But societal problems evolve from messy histories.For example, neighborhoods with poor canopy coverage are often places where racial oppression intersects with every aspect of residents¡¦ lives, making the isolation of a single problem with a single solution impossible. Failure to account for historical context can lead to failure to address fundamental neighborhood concerns.2. Decision-making excludes frontline communitiesThe initial planning for Houston¡¦s enormous Bayou Greenways 2020 parks project laudably included an extensive public outreach effort. But its online-only survey in 2014 polled those residents who were easiest to survey, rather than a representative sample of the population, many of whom lack internet access. Predictably, the process failed to give adequate voice to poor and non-white residents: two-thirds of survey respondents were white with household annual incomes greater than 75,000.Government officials inadvertently can separate sustainability from racial equity when they solicit public input. The people most capable of participating ¡X whose economic, educational and linguistic advantages make participation easier ¡X have outsized influence on government actions. Meanwhile, people who lack resources, time, legal status or comfort with government institutions often find their priorities and concerns underrepresented and unaddressed. And for many of these people, these unaddressed concerns speak to how proposed government actions can be influenced by racial oppression.Houston recognized problems with its Bayou Greenways outreach and re-surveyed the public about a year later, this time using open-ended questions in in-person interviews in English and Spanish. Researchers found that representation clearly mattered for determining project priorities and planning.3. Programs distribute burdens and benefits inequitablyWhile most people are willing to make sacrifices to help their communities, no one wants an unfair share. Perceptions of inequitable burdens can lead to non-participation and even uprisings, such as in the Yellow Vest protests in France. On the other hand, if the rewards of sustainability are unfairly distributed, green projects can exacerbate social inequities.For example, many local programs focused on increasing the use of residential solar energy have used tax breaks and similar incentive mechanisms, which are more likely to be relevant to wealthy, white homeowners with access to the credit and tax equity needed to participate. This has led to unequal distribution of local solar.At the intersection of urban sustainability and racial justice is a useful, powerful concept: Government should use its privileged capacity to elevate frontline leadership. By extension, actions should be designed through centering the needs of frontline communities, those most affected by racism and climate change.Government can offer its various forms of capacity ¡X including legal authorities, asset ownership, relationships with business communities, convening power, staff with elite educations, technical expertise and data and information ¡X to collaborate with frontline communities and organizations and improve the lives of residents. Having this capacity, and the power that comes with it, is a privilege in a democracy with deep inequality.Cities can refocus how they do business on around listening to those residents who have the greatest knowledge of how society and government actions affect the most afflicted and to those organizations with the greatest access to and moral authority with their neighbors.So, what does this mean in practice?The first task for governments implementing sustainability projects is to proactively recruit leaders from frontline communities. One way to do this is by partnering with existing social justice organizations. In Portland, Oregon, environmental nonprofits provided technical and organizational expertise to the Portland Clean Energy Fund Coalition, a group of six social justice organizations with deep roots in Portland¡¦s communities of color. Frontline leadership played an instrumental role in the successful passage of a package of tax-supported clean energy grants expected to total 44 million¡V61 million; BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) leadership was central to winning trust and endorsements from the public sector and trade unions.To proactively recruit frontline leaders, local governments should assess and remove potential barriers to participation. That can include consideration of meeting times and spaces, as well as providing childcare, meals, stipends, transportation and interpreters. This process can be a starting point for creating or enhancing relationships with community and social justice organizations.Frontline residents and leaders may not speak and think in the same terms as city staffers, and some orientation and translation may be required. It can be useful to ground technical discussions in narratives and lived experiences to build common vocabularies out of various cultural and technical reference points, and to be ready to be flexible about timelines and project goals. Most important, governments need to listen openly and honor community expertise.A key role for frontline leaders is to guide the community to define meaningful indicators for success ¡X for evaluating future clean energy scenarios, for evaluating program success and for evaluating the processes to achieve success. One of government¡¦s roles is to provide timely, reliable data and modeling, and to make data and model outcomes accessible to the community. But indicator definition, scenario development and evaluation, and model validation are all tasks that intersect with community values and priorities, so these roles belong to the community.The city of Orlando, Florida, developed its 100 percent?renewable energy plan after a series of data-rich community engagements. Orlando staffers worked with Greenlink Analytics to produce data visualizations and maps designed to be easily understood and enable open, substantive discussion with community residents.The maps go beyond standard energy indicators and include equity dimensions such as energy burden (the portion of household income spent paying for electricity and gas bills), making visible city-wide inequities in poverty and energy costs and enabling further conversation on ways to focus future city programming in frontline communities.A utility burden represents the percentage of annual income that a household or individual pays toward their utility bills (electricity, natural gas, and/or water). This map is taken from an interactive dashboard of Orlando's utility burden developed by?Greenlink Analytics.Program implementation is where the rubber of a sustainability plan meets the road of impacts in the lives of residents. Policy selection, roll-out design and financing decisions all influence the final distribution of program benefits and therefore can spark important debates about fairness amid the tension between equality and equity. Because an equitable implementation plan could be vastly different from the status quo, it might feel starkly unequal.Scenario assessment and policy prioritization, traditionally the purview of technocratic planners, should be led by the people with the greatest stakes in the outcomes. In a set of community engagement sessions, Orlando¡¦s planners presented visually simple (but analytically sophisticated) clean energy calculators.The calculators enabled residents to translate energy efficiency, solar power and EV adoption targets into greenhouse gas emissions expressed in terms that would be meaningful to residents: bill savings; job creation; and public health.?Centering climate and energy planning on racial justice is no small task, with numerous obstacles in local governments¡¦ paths to equitable energy policy and program design. But by applying governments¡¦ capacities to empower frontline leadership, city staff can start to flip the script on typical planning conversations and build trust with frontline communities.\",\n",
              " 'Thomas Koch Blank, head of breakthrough technologies at RMI, says the green steel industry is at the beginning of an S curve. Almost 2 billion tons of steel are produced each year, and half of that is virgin material. Producing steel is responsible for about 7 to 9 percent of total global carbon emissions. So, it¡¦s easy to understand why there¡¦s a lot of investment pouring into creating sustainable steel technologies.?According to Blank, the production of green steel is ramping up slowly compared to the number of resources coming in, a.k.a. the bottom of the S.?Still, there has been a wave of recent developments. A Bill Gates-backed startup, Boston Metal, working to create a CO2-free steel process, raised 50 million in funding in January. In Sweden, 3.99 billion will help build a new commercial hydrogen steel plant. Swedish miner?LKAB?is investing 46 billion to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. But there¡¦s still a long way to go before legacy steel manufacturers across the globe can decarbonize entirely, according to Blank.??\"When the Chinese steel industry starts moving, that¡¦s when you get out of the fringes in my mind,\" he said. \"They haven¡¦t made any specific or any real investments yet.\"Who¡¦s making moves towards a greener steel economy? Here are three companies and approaches that hopefully will get us to the S curve¡¦s inflection point.?Japanese steel manufacturer Kobe Steel recently developed a new technique for creating steel in natural gas blast furnaces that use less coke, a raw material with a high carbon content used in steel production. By adding hot briquetted iron (iron ore with the oxygen removed) to the blast furnaces as a fuel source at a precise ratio, Kobe said it has perfected a way to maintain the efficiency of the CO2 reduction process and use less coke as fuel.?\"It¡¦s an optimization of the distribution of substances that go into the blast furnace,\" said Masahiro Motoyuki, executive officer of Kobe Steel.According to Kobe, the process reduces CO2 emissions associated with production by about 20 percent. While this is not a final solution to the steel industry¡¦s carbon emission woes, Kobe is positioning this as a transitional technology to help reduce emissions while it develops more drastic changes. But Blank sees this as a risky and expensive investment in something that might be obsolete in a few years if the steel industry is trying to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.?\"If you need to gradually get to zero emissions over 30 years, cutting your emissions by 20 percent buys 20 percent of the 30 years, so that gives you six years,\" he said. \"That technology is only relevant for six years. They need more effective technologies installed very soon; otherwise, they¡¦re not on track. But they¡¦re actually reducing their carbon footprint, which is to their credit a lot more than most of the steel industry.\"?It seems Kobe knows it has a timeline issue and is investing in other production technologies such as hydrogen in parallel with the efficient blast furnaces. Its U.S. subsidiary, Midrex Technologies, is working on natural gas blast furnaces that also can use hydrogen for a completely carbon-free process once there is enough hydrogen available for commercial steel use.?Hydrogen offers one possibility of a completely carbon dioxide-free process for making steel, according to some experts. In traditional blast furnaces, coal is used to strip the oxygen out of the iron ore, creating steel and CO2. According to the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association and? By using hydrogen instead of coal for that process, the byproduct is water (H2O) instead of CO2.?A partnership between Netherlands-based EIT InnoEnergy, a sustainable innovations accelerator funded by the European Union, investor Vargas Holdings and Scania, a Swedish truck manufacturer, is working to bring this dream to a commercial reality. These partners are developing a fully scaled commercial hydrogen steel plant called H2 Green Steel. The plant will produce 5 million metric tons of green steel by 2024, making it the largest green steel plant in the world, according to the partners.??Jacob Ruiter, CE0 Benelux?at?EIT InnoEnergy, said having a joint partnership and a buyer for the steel already on board before the venture started building the plant allowed it to avoid obstacles that previously have stifled the development of hydrogen steel plants.?\"In order for this to work, steel manufacturers have to change their mindset,\" he said. \"Think in terms of value chain. So it¡¦s not about the price of the hydrogen or the steel. It¡¦s the price of the end product like the car. Will there be an increase in the price of the end product? What is the end customer willing to pay?\"InnoEnergy said it found using steel made sustainably only increased the price of a car by about 36, a negligible amount for the consumer. Instead of steel buyers such as car companies looking for the lowest steel prices and steel manufacturers competing to get their steel to the lowest possible price to win the market, it encouraged these stakeholders to join forces to create a green steel that is also affordable.?According to Blank, the biggest obstacle to hydrogen steel production is the vast amounts of renewable energy needed to keep the process carbon-free.?\"If you want to take the current primary steel production and electrify it, you¡¦ll need a terawatt of electrolyzers, which is a lot,\" he said.?Basically, the three planned green steel plants in?Sweden would need 50 percent of the current? power supply. According to Blank, globally, we will need closer to one terrawatt of electrolyzers powered by three?terrawats of renewables. Three terrawats is about three times the total solar and wind power?currently?installed.??? Blank also pointed to an anticipated explosion in electricity demand, spurred by world population growth over the next 30 years, as another challenge to overcome.The H2 Green Steel plant will be built in Sweden¡¦s Norrbotten region, which has access to vast amounts of reliable hydro and wind power. Blank said if hydrogen-based steel production is?to expand beyond Sweden to other large steel manufacturing countries such as China and the United States, significant investment will need to occur in renewable energy.?A new technology originally created at MIT, molten oxide electrolysis, aims to separate the oxygen from the iron ore using electricity and creating O2 as the byproduct instead of CO2. Boston Metal is tasked with bringing this technology to a commercial level for the steel industry.?Over the next two to three years, the company hopes to take its laboratory success and bring it to market. It¡¦s focusing on regions such as Europe, Canada and Australia where there is easy access to renewable energy because like hydrogen steel, the electrolysis process requires access to large amounts of clean power to keep the process carbon-free all the way down the pipeline.?Adam Rauwerdink, vice president of business development at Boston Metal, thinks electrolysis has one notable advantage over hydrogen ¡X it is a direct way of removing iron ore in fewer steps.\"If you¡¦re going to do hydrogen for steel production, you¡¦re ultimately focused on using green hydrogen,\" he said. \"Which is using electricity to do electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. So there¡¦s electrolysis involved. You¡¦re just adding extra steps because then you¡¦re taking that hydrogen, using that to make a sponge iron and then remelting that to a similar product that we¡¦re producing. We think we are simplifying the process.\"Each company and technology is taking aim at the 1 billion tons of virgin steel?produced each year for buildings, factories, cars, planes and other infrastructure projects. And there isn¡¦t one solution to rule them all, according to Blank. It will take many innovations and pathways to decarbonize this extremely carbon heavy industry.?\"I think there will be room in the market for all of them,\" Blank said. \"It will take 1,000 million tons to transform the whole industry. You just need a lot of technology and a lot of new assets.\"Correction: A previous version of this article stated that 50 percent of global power would is needed??to power the?green steel sector. This has been corrected to 50 percent of power?in Sweden is?needed for Sweden\\'s currently planned green steel facilities.',\n",
              " 'In Indonesia, climate change is already a pernicious threat. More than 30 million people across northern Java suffer from coastal flooding and erosion related to more severe storms and sea level rise. In some places, entire villages and more than a mile of coastline have been lost to the sea.The flooding and erosion are exacerbated by the destruction of natural mangrove forests. These forests absorb the brunt of waves¡¦ impact, significantly reducing both the height and speed of waves reaching shore. And mature mangroves can store nearly 1,000 tons of carbon per hectare, thus mitigating climate change while also helping communities adapt.Without mangroves, 18 million more people worldwide would suffer from coastal flooding each year (an increase of 39 percent). That¡¦s why in Demak, Java, a diverse group of residents, NGOs, universities and the Indonesian government are working together on the \"Building with Nature\" project to restore a 12-mile belt of mangroves. The project, managed by Wetlands International, already has improved the district¡¦s climate resilience, protecting communities from coastal flooding and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Java isn¡¦t the only place where nature-based solutions can make a difference. Countries around the world can harness the power of nature to adapt to climate impacts. Coastal wetlands can defend communities from storm surge and sea level rise. Well-managed forests can protect water supplies, reduce wildfire risk and prevent landslides. Green space in cities can alleviate heat stress and reduce flooding.While we don¡¦t yet have a full accounting of this potential, we do know that, for instance, wetland ecosystems cover about 8 percent of the planet¡¦s land surface and the ecosystem services they provide ¡X including flood protection, fisheries habitat and water purification ¡X are worth up to 15 trillion. For example, offshore fisheries in areas with mangroves provide fishermen with an average of 271 pounds of fish (worth about 44) per hour, compared to an average of 40 pounds (only 2 to 3 per hour in places without mangroves).Yet despite nature¡¦s ability to provide vast economic and climate resilience benefits, many countries are not fully using nature-based solutions for adaptation, according to research by the U.N. Environment Program World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) produced for the Global Commission on Adaptation. Of 167 Nationally Determined Contributions submitted under the Paris Agreement, just 70 include nature-based adaptation actions; the majority of those are in low-income countries.The Global Commission on Adaptation is working with leading organizations and countries, including the governments of Canada, Mexico and Peru, the Global Environment Facility and the U.N. Environment Program, to scale these approaches globally through its Nature-Based Solutions Action Track. According to the Commission¡¦s Adapt Now report?¡X which builds on UNEP-WCMC¡¦s research ¡X?three crucial steps are needed to make this happen:Policymakers need to better understand the value of natural capital such as mangroves and other ecosystems that provide important benefits for communities. For example, it can be 2 to 5 times cheaper to restore coastal wetlands than to construct breakwaters ?¡X artificial barriers typically made out of granite ¡X yet both protect coasts from the impact of waves. The median cost for mangrove restoration is about 1 cent per square foot. This is far less than the often prohibitive cost of most built infrastructure. Mangrove areas yield other benefits, too, as illustrated by the effect on fisheries. In fact, the commission found the total net benefits of protecting mangroves globally is 1 trillion by 2030.While some research of this kind exists, countries often need place-specific assessments to identify the best opportunities to use nature-based solutions for adaptation. Governments also should consider that local and indigenous communities often have ample understanding of nature¡¦s value for people, and should seek out and include this knowledge in plans and policies. The success of the \"Building with Nature\" project, for example, relied on the full involvement of local residents.Nature-based solutions often work best when people use them at larger scales ¡X across whole landscapes, ecosystems or cities. Governments are often best placed to plan climate adaptation at this scale given their access to resources and ability to make policy and coordinate among multiple actors. To be successful, they should include nature-based solutions in their adaptation planning from the start.Mexico¡¦s approach to water management highlights how one way this can be achieved. Water supplies are especially vulnerable to climate change, as shifting rainfall patterns cause droughts in some places and floods in others. Mexico is proactively protecting its water on a national scale by designating water reserves in more than one-third of the country¡¦s river basins. These protected areas and wetlands cover nearly 124 million acres and ensure a secure water supply for some 45 million people downstream.This approach can work in many other places. Research on cities¡¦ water supplies shows that by conserving and restoring upstream forests, water utilities in the world¡¦s 534 largest cities could better regulate water flows and collectively save 890 million in treatment costs each year.Communities and countries often cite access to funding as a barrier to implementing nature-based solutions, and to climate adaptation efforts overall. But, as UNEP-WCMC highlights, governments can spur investment in these approaches by reorienting their policies, subsidies and public investments. They can also better incentivize private investors to finance adaptation projects.Many governments, private sector and philanthropic actors have funds that could be used for nature-based adaptation solutions ¡X but a lack of awareness has hindered their widespread use. Part of the solution is helping communities and countries better understand what funding opportunities exist, learn from successful financing models and identify gaps that could be filled by interested donor countries, development institutions and private investors ¡X an effort the commission is undertaking.Canada¡¦s 1.6 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund is one example of a public financing approach. This fund helps communities manage risks from floods, wildfires, droughts and other natural hazards by providing investments in both green (nature-based) and gray (built) infrastructure. Much like the mangroves in Indonesia, Canada has its own coastal wetlands that protect its coasts from sea level rise. The fund recently invested 20 million into a project that is restoring salt marshes and improving levees along the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. Once complete, the Bay of Fundy project will reduce coastal flooding that affects tens of thousands of residents, including indigenous communities, as well as World Heritage sites and more than 49,000 acres of farmland.The benefits of nature-based solutions go far beyond climate adaptation. From the heart of the city to vast forests and coastal wetlands, healthy ecosystems underpin societies and economies. They provide food, fuel and livelihoods; sustain cultural traditions; and offer health and recreation benefits. Many of these solutions actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, serving as climate mitigation strategies as well. They also provide critical habitat for biodiversity.The Global Commission on Adaptation is establishing a group of frontrunner countries, cities and communities to highlight successes, stimulate greater commitments and increase attention to nature¡¦s underappreciated role in climate adaptation. By taking these steps to scale up nature-based solutions, we can realize the potential of nature to advance climate adaptation and protect those most likely to be affected by climate change.',\n",
              " 'Greenhouse gas emissions are on track to plunge nearly 8 percent this year, the largest drop recorded. The decline in large part is due to the reduced fossil fuel demands as people across the globe lockdown and stay at home.?But emission reductions won¡¦t last. Why would it? We haven¡¦t been designing for emission reductions; we¡¦ve been quitting travel and to address a different problem. As every crash dieter knows, deprivation can get short-term gains but is a poor strategy for long-term health.?To sustain ¡X and deepen ¡X emission reductions, we need a transformational shift in how we power the economy.?The silver lining: COVID teaches us that we are collectively capable of more transformation than we thought. The only thing worse than a pandemic would be to not learn anything from a pandemic.?It turns out the global community is capable of great things. I am floored to see how we have come together in collective sacrifice to accomplish something for the greater good.?That¡¦s good news, because the COVID crisis is kind of like stretching before the climate crisis marathon.?Scientists agree that to have a chance at a safe climate future, we have to see about an 8 percent decline in emissions every year.Energy Innovation sees coordinated policy as key to changing our emissions trajectory, which it says is set to rebound to pre-COVID levels by 2025. The nonpartisan policy firm¡¦s U.S. Energy Policy Simulator shows the long-term emissions benefits of U.S. energy policies and was just updated to capture the COVID recession in its modeling.?Playing around with the tool is an interesting look at the real-world impacts of individual policies. It¡¦s also sobering; it shows how much would need to be done to meet the Paris climate goals.?\"There¡¦s no one silver bullet climate policy,\" said Megan Mahajan, a policy analyst at Energy Innovation, in a phone conversation. \"It really takes a combination of policies to drive emissions down in every sector.\"?As we figure out what we¡¦re building post-COVID, it¡¦s a good time to consider which policies would be most impactful. For example, research and development funding could pair nicely with standards to drive adoption.??\"That¡¦s what¡¦s needed to get really large fundamental change,\" Mahajan said.?LevelTen, a platform that tracks renewable energy projects, did the math to find out how much new wind and solar alone would be needed to see the emission reductions from COVID. Its answer: around 1100 gigawatts ¡X about seven times the amount of renewable energy capacity added globally last year.?Will Jolley, author of the analysis and manager of technical sales at LevelTen, finds the number encouraging. It outlines an action corporations and utilities can take to encourage economic development while working towards the goal of reduced emissions.\"We see a very large growth potential for global renewable energy development,\" said Jolley in a phone conversation, citing the European Union¡¦s green deal and growing renewable demand in Asia.?While emissions will rebound as the economy reopens, companies may be transforming habits that have lasting impacts.Elizabeth Thomas, assistant professor of geology at the University at Buffalo, deployed her students to look into and quantify how local companies could keep emissions low post-COVID.According to Thomas, companies that were resistant to remote work now see it as possible. Same goes for travel policies.\"They were willing to adapt, but they had to be forced to try it at first,\" said Thomas in a phone conversation. \"Once they tried it, they realized that employees could still be productive, they could still have meaningful meetings via online platforms, and now are willing to try to implement that long term.\"Some tech companies already have committed to this switch. Both Twitter and Square announced this week that employees permanently will work from home.?While remote work policies aren¡¦t revolutionary, the agility of the private sector to respond to a crisis is heartening. Corporate leadership has been, and will continue to be, key and shifting mindsets and policies to further reduce emissions.?Despite what incumbent energy producers say, it is possible to grow the economy and reduce emissions ¡X indeed, the United States largely has decoupled emissions and economic growth, as have dozens of other developed nations.?As we restart everything, we have an opportunity to shift away from the polluting, fragile, extractive system we¡¦ve been using and build something for the future.?The Rocky Mountain Institute has been giving some thought to this. It just released the first in a series of reports on the global principles of recovery, identifying four pillars of building a new-and-improved low-carbon economy:Many of these principles are connected and support one another. Clean energy is job-rich, gives back to the economy, reduces pollution and makes us more resilient. All we need to do is do it.?Apparently, the kids today ¡X aka tomorrow¡¦s leaders ¡X get this urgency and will fight for it.?\"There\\'s a generation of students passionate about moving the needle on carbon emission education,\" Thomas said. \"They see their lives are already impacted by climate change and will be even more in the future. So they\\'re very passionate, very smart and incredibly motivated to make this happen.\"',\n",
              " 'Lake Maumelle in central Arkansas is a blue gem surrounded by rich forests of oak, hickory and short-leaf pine. Not only is it popular with local boaters and fishers, it also supplies much of the drinking water to half a million people in and around Little Rock. However, much of the land around the lake is privately owned. The forests on this land are at risk of being cleared for development, threatening both the beautiful vista and drinking water quality.Recognizing this threat, Central Arkansas Water (CAW), the local water utility, implemented a watershed protection fee to raise funds to acquire and protect the forest land. But to acquire forests at a larger scale, CAW needed to raise more capital from the private market and decided to issue a bond.Bonding to protect forests for water quality is still novel in the world of finance and investment. CAW partnered with green finance experts Encourage Capital and WRI to pioneer the first certified green bond to acquire forests for watershed protection. The 31.8 million bond will allow CAW to borrow money from investors and pay them back over time.The \"green\" signifies that the borrowed money will fund projects with environmental and social benefits, such as investments in low-carbon infrastructure and natural infrastructure such as forests. The \"certified\" indicates that the bond meets established water infrastructure criteria and commits the issuer to following transparent reporting guidelines.When CAW issued the bond in November, the capital markets responded enthusiastically. After receiving bids from several banks, CAW sold the bond to Morgan Stanley.\"Morgan Stanley is deeply committed to the green bond market and its ability to capitalize much-needed sustainable infrastructure projects,\" said Zachary Solomon, an executive director with the bank. \"We were excited by the opportunity to underwrite a bond that meets the markets¡¦ demand for products that drive both financial and environmental outcomes.\"Here are three lessons from the world¡¦s first green bond to invest in forests for water quality:Through this green bond, CAW will invest in some traditional \"gray\" infrastructure, such as pipelines, generators and other improvements to the delivery systems. But 33 percent of the green bond proceeds are earmarked for green infrastructure to support forestland acquisitions, conservation easements and other protection measures in the watershed.Forests protect utilities¡¦ drinking water in several ways. Forests¡¦ leaves, roots and rich soil act as a filter to keep pollution out of water by preventing erosion and absorbing nutrients and sediment. Forests also regulate local water cycles by storing water and releasing water vapor, which can influence rainfall, and blocking and slowing the flow of runoff from storms and floods. But when forests are disturbed and degraded, the cycles are disrupted and sediment flows into streams and pollutes water.WRI research shows that a combined \"green-gray\" approach, which uses both human-made and natural infrastructure, is often an effective and low-cost way to protect water sources. In one of the most well-known examples, New York City invested 1.7 billion to protect more than 1 million acres of mostly forested watershed in the Catskills to save on water filtration costs. While the city continues to use networks of pipes and water storage, forest conservation allowed the city to avoid 6 billion to 8 billion on the cost of building a new water filtration plant.And it¡¦s not just the water supply that will benefit. Protecting forests can yield important climate and human benefits, such as carbon sequestration, increased biodiversity, improved health, access to recreation and job creation. The environmental and social benefits of the bond also attract investors interested in greening their portfolios and fulfilling sustainable finance commitments.Acquiring and protecting forestland requires a large up-front infusion of cash. It can take months, or even years, to unlock public and philanthropic funding in the amounts needed to acquire significant amounts of land. However, the capital markets can raise capital very quickly and efficiently, but only with a trusted repayment mechanism to assure investors that they will get their money back.CAW is relying on its current rate structure for ratepayers and the dedicated watershed protection fee to repay the bond and the 2.136 percent true interest cost. CAW¡¦s investment in forests will yield future savings through avoiding water treatment costs and potentially generate future revenue streams through voluntary carbon offsets, timber harvests and non-timber forest products. Investors see this as a good bet because utilities have predictable cash flows generated from providing an essential service ¡X in this instance, supplying drinking water. This means the investors are likely to get their money back, while the \"green\" label ensures that their investment meets verified environmental criteria. This is increasingly important as institutional investors such as pension funds look to increase their investments in green projects.How do investors know that the investments are truly green, and not just a marketing ploy? For certified green bonds, third-party verifiers assure investors that the proceeds of the bond will be invested in climate-related or green projects that meet certified criteria. The bond was certified under the Climate Bonds Initiative¡¦s water infrastructure criteria. This criteria was developed by the Water Consortium, including WRI, and supports green-gray approaches that advance climate mitigation and resilience.Green bonds are gaining momentum in the market place with more than 222 billion in issuances in 2020, recently surpassing 1 trillion in cumulative issuances since the first green bond in 2007. This represents a broader shift to green investments, despite the pandemic-related economic downturn. In the capital markets, U.S. environmental, social and governance (ESG) index funds are outperforming traditional index funds for a variety of reasons, including reduced investment in energy and fossil fuels.Municipalities and utilities can follow in CAW¡¦s footsteps by replicating and innovating on their model. Healthy watersheds protect drinking water quality and quantity. With low interest rates and access to cheap capital, it is a good time to raise funds for long-term planning projects, such as green-gray infrastructure.This green debt instrument previously has been used for stormwater management investments by San Francisco¡¦s Public Water Utility with annual operating budgets around 1.4 billion and New York City Water n excess of 1.5 billion. With CAW¡¦s issuance, medium-sized utilities with annual operating budgets around 60 million are getting into the game. CAW¡¦s green bond also will be the first to emphasize the value of cities¡¦ \"nearby forests,\" not just urban green infrastructure such as street trees and green drainage systems.CAW¡¦s green bond exemplifies a true win-win-win situation for investors, local utilities and residents. The dedicated watershed protection fee is the foundation for CAW¡¦s recent success, allowing the utility to raise capital for a long-term investment in natural infrastructure and take advantage of the low interest rates on the bond market. The green bond platform helps investors find strong projects to allocate earmarked \"green\" capital, supporting a much-needed transition towards low-carbon investments. The residents of Little Rock and the surrounding area benefit from a protected watershed in the form of clean drinking water without paying additional fees.\"Our priority is providing high-quality water to our 500,000 recipients in an affordable and efficient manner,\" CAW Chief Executive Officer Tad Bohannan said, \"and green bonds are one more tool in our toolbox that we can use as we strive to deliver on that priority in a manner that also provides many co-benefits to our communities.\"Residents in Little Rock and surrounding areas will start to see more benefits than a protected watershed. Recreation will expand around the lake, wildlife will thrive in the protected habitat and the air may even become cleaner. The 6 billion timber industry may benefit from sustainable harvesting, supplying local jobs and raw materials. Perhaps most important, residents will be able to turn on the water faucet and count on the clean drinking water for generations to come.',\n",
              " 'Over the last year, I\\'ve had the distinct pleasure of rounding up the week¡¦s most influential and eye-catching circular headlines. From single-use plastics bans to an upcycled food certification, it¡¦s been a momentous year for the circular economy, supply chain shenanigans and safety concerns notwithstanding.Much like the snow outside, the slow but steady progress of circularity shows no signs of stopping. So with a healthy dose of cocoa in my cup and a proverbial rear view mirror in my gaze, I¡¦m delighted to share my final hot takes for 2021. Here¡¦s my vote for the year\\'s three most impactful trends in circularity:A constant drumbeat across the sustainability sector ¡X and at any GreenBiz conference ¡X is the agreement that policy is a critical driver for the future we hope to achieve. In the case of 2021, circularity has started to prove the rule.The Right to Repair movement saw traction across the pond, as repairability scores for electronics rolled out in France, appliances gained repair protections in Britain and the EU proposed universal charging cords for smartphones.Meanwhile on our side of the Atlantic: The first electronics right to repair bill was passed in New York state, a national repair bill was filed in congress and President Joe Biden signed an executive order to ensure repairability for farming equipment. The Federal Trade Commission even weighed in with an exhaustive 55-page report, rejecting manufacturers¡¦ excuses for imposed repair restrictions.Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) also made state history, when Maine became the first state to pass a consumer packaging EPR bill, with Oregon quickly following suit. And in California, no fewer than seven recycling and composting bills were signed into law ¡X?perhaps the most notorious of which will require packaging donning the chasing arrows symbol to actually be recycled in practice.At the federal level, a national EPR bill was introduced and recycling was thrown a political bone when the Department of Energy invested 14 million in recycling research and the newly passed Infrastructure Bill unlocked 350 million in grants for recycling.Finally, PFAS came under scrutiny when Vermont banned forever chemicals from select products, the EPA outlined PFAS limitations and regulations and the PFAS Action Act of 2021 cleared the House.So what¡¦s so unexpected? This entirely non-exhaustive list speaks to a pivotal year. But what excites me most is not the movement and passage of legislation ¡X joy-inducing though it is ¡X it¡¦s the ripple effects that follow across industry and sector. Take PFAS for example: As forever chemicals made their way under the political magnifying glass, coverage and attention followed, and, while legislation didn¡¦t require it, major brands from VF Corporation to McDonalds and beyond made announcements to ban or limit their PFAS dependencies.Similar ripples followed for the Right to Repair movement: After years of active resistance, heavy-hitters in the electronics industry began to show a change of heart when it came to repair. Policy may not yet demand it, but both Apple and Microsoft have agreed to make parts and manuals more accessible for consumers. For those in the know, this reversal was shocking (and a huge deal.) Of course, legislative movement is not the only driver here. Years of activism, pressure and hard work have helped catapult many of these wins. But the splash of policy creates waves across industry. While the line from bill to brand action is not always a straight shot, the undeniable impact of policy change remains clear in 2021.If you¡¦re a frequent reader of the roundup, it¡¦ll come as no surprise that my second trend of 2021 reflects the explosive growth of resale. Growing 25 times faster than the retail market and projected to be double the size of fast fashion by 2030, resale stole headlines and hearts throughout the year.Want proof? Look no further than the highly anticipated and even more highly covered IPOs for Poshmark and ThredUp. The market debuts of these popular secondhand e-commerce platforms garnered 7.4 billion and 1.3 billion valuations, respectively ¡X but that¡¦s not where the jaw-dropping coverage stopped.Money poured into the market like it was going out of style: Kering invested 216 million in French resale marketplace Vestiaire Collective; Resale service provider Trove raked in 77.5 million in Series D funding; Lithuanian second hand fashion platform Vinted raised 283 million. And proving that the popularity wasn¡¦t exclusive to the fashion world, Back Market, a French e-commerce platform for refurbished electronics, raised 312 million.Making acquisitions in the space, Etsy dropped 1.62 billion to purchase secondhand clothing app Depop and ThredUp set eyes on the European market when it acquired Remix, a popular fashion resale platform in the EU.And in case that¡¦s not enough accolades for you, consider the number of brands that announced a resale pilot, project or partnership this year. Just to name a few: Nordstrom; Lululemon; Nike; Madewell; Timberland; IKEA; H&M; NewBalance; Crocs; Diesel; Adidas; Fabletics; and Vera Bradley are among them.Will 2022 prove another explosive year for resale? All signs point to yes. The question that lingers for me is if resale will help curb consumption and, by association, the outsized environmental impact of garment production and the fashion industry writ large. So far, the answer seems murky.Last but not least, it was a year of uncomfortable truths for the plastics industry. With new statistics and evidence in tow, numerous reports raised red flags and troubling revelations for both population and planet.Among the reports were several causes for concern should we continue plastic-consumption-as-usual. A report published by Google revealed that maintaining the status quo would result in a terrifying 7.7 gigatons of plastic waste being landfilled, incinerated or leaked into the environment by 2040 ¡X equivalent to 16 times the weight of the entire human population on earth today. Meanwhile a Beyond Plastics report outlined that greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production are set to outpace those from coal plants by 2030.A study by the American Chemical Society further revealed that about 24 percent of the 10,400 chemicals identified in plastics are \"substances of potential concern\" and can be toxic, even in small doses. But lack of research means 49 percent of the chemicals cannot be properly categorized, making their safety ¡X or lack there of ¡X unknown.Unfortunately, as we barrel towards the new year it appears we¡¦re not on track for a variety of packaging commitments intended (in part) to curb plastic production. According to new research, 90 percent of 2025 packaging commitments will not be met, and the 2022 recycled content commitments in California look unlikely as well.Looking for culprits, a Greenpeace report pointed fingers at CPGs for failing to reduce single-use plastic packaging; a study by the Minderoo Foundation identified 20 companies responsible for 55 percent of global single-use plastic waste; a Portfolio.earth report exposed banks¡¦ role in providing 1.7 trillion in plastic production funding; and a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine revealed the U.S. as the largest consumer of plastic globally.My hope for 2022 and beyond is a change in the plastic tide. If brands intend to meet the 2025 packaging goals they¡¦ve so loudly and proudly made, they need to start acting like it ¡X?starting by reversing dependency on this toxic, carbon-emitting material.While plastics, policy and resale took home the top slots for 2021, I would be remiss not to note the trend runner-ups of a newsworthy year. Here are my honorable mentions:With that, I tip my hat to quite the year of coverage ¡X it certainly was one for the books. See you for another year of circular advancement and adventure in 2022.',\n",
              " 'At this time last year, I was preparing for a low-key New Year¡¦s Eve, feeling apprehensive yet optimistic about the prospects for climate tech in 2021. Since then, I have been disheartened by the firm grip the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have on everyday life. But I\\'ve been lifted by the surge of support for technologies intended to address and mitigate humankind¡¦s climate-messing impact on the planet.The activity in climate tech has been breathtaking over the past 12 months. If 2020 was a breakthrough year for climate tech, then 2021 was breakthrough 2.0.?As PwC notes in its year-end report on the state of climate tech, startups focused on this category accounted for 14 cents of every venture capital dollar committed as of the first half of 2021, and that trend looks to be continuing. Deal sizes for climate tech quadrupled in the 12 months ended June 30, to an average of 96 million. Seventy-eight climate tech startups are worth more than 1 billion (a.k.a unicorns), 43 of which are from the transportation and mobility technology categories.?PwC¡¦s total tally for the 12-month period was 87.5 billion in overall climate tech investments, although the deals keep coming, and we¡¦ve yet to see the accounting for the second half of 2021. One meaty example: Just before many people started shunning their laptops for an extended year-end holiday, the corporate venture arm of food company Archer Daniels Midland emerged as the lead investor in a record-breaking 347 million round of funding for Israel¡¦s Future Meat Technologies, a maker of \"cultivated\" meat. It is working on beef, chicken, lamb and pork offerings.??Several smaller rounds were disclosed as 2021 waned, including a 10 million infusion for supply chain emissions reporting software company SupplyShift; the same amount for carbon removal startup Sustaera (also one of Stripe¡¦s latest investments) led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures; 30 million for \"vertically integrated carbon capture and sequestration super developer\" Carbon America, which is helping building pilots; and 170 million in funding for UBQ Materials, developing a plastics substitute made from household waste.?As you can appreciate, there¡¦s clearly no shortage of money and no shortage of places where that moolah could be invested. PwC estimates more than 6,000 investors are targeting the space ¡X aside from high-profile specialists including the likes of Lowercarbon Capital or Breakthrough Energy Ventures, many mainstream private equity firms and asset managers including TPG and BlackRock are positioning themselves to participate.Where will this all lead in 2022? As the people behind that money gear up for 2022, here is my simple wish list for ways in which they can ensure 2022 will become the third breakthrough year in a row for climate tech ¡X not just in terms of actual money invested but in terms of potential positive future impact.As PwC notes in its analysis, the number of seed funding and Series A deals focused on climate tech startups has remained relatively stagnant on an annual basis since 2018. That doesn¡¦t bode well over time. \"More patient funding is needed for currently immature challenge areas to unlock the next wave of breakthrough climate innovations,\" note the authors of the firm¡¦s analysis.A telling data point. While transportation and mobility is the climate tech category that has cumulatively received the most funding ¡X accounting for north of 58 billion from 2013 through the first half of 2021 ¡X just 113.5 million of that amount was focused on 15 startups related to shipping. Mind you, that money doesn¡¦t account for the massive R&D engines of industry leaders such as Maersk or Mitsubishi, but it¡¦s a gap.?The work of corporate funders, notably Amazon, Microsoft, Shopify and Stripe, has been particularly helpful in building credibility for still-unproven companies across several categories. Sustaera¡¦s carbon removal contract with Stripe, for example, was revealed the day before its 10 million Series A round came to light.?Here¡¦s hoping some of the ambitious corporate purchasing commitments being announced by the likes of the First Mover¡¦s Coalition will get more catalytic capital behind scaling applied technology ventures that need a bigger boost than your typical enterprise software startup. And here¡¦s also hoping the founders of those ventures are far more diverse ¡X from a gender and racial perspective?¡X than has traditionally been the norm.?Whenever I talk to civilians about climate tech, they invariably ask me: What technologies are you most excited about?And invariably, the first things that jump to mind for me are developments that aren¡¦t all that flashy but that would disrupt the economics of processes such as manufacturing or construction or agriculture in favor of approaches that are good for the planet. Over the past few months, I¡¦ve developed a serious appreciation for the mantra espoused by At One Ventures, the firm co-founded by former Google X astrophysicist Tom Chi: \"To catalyze a world where humanity is a net positive to nature.\"At One Ventures mission is to find disruptive ventures that have \"radically better unit economics\" than the traditional way of doing things. \"Unit economics win the day, as opposed to political action or ire,\" Chi told me.?As I chatted with him earlier this month, I found myself wanting to know more about virtually every startup in his company¡¦s portfolio. (I highly encourage you to take a closer look.)?Take Cruz Foam, an early-stage circular economic startup making a Styrofoam packaging alternative out of aquaculture waste such as shrimp shells that breaks down in 60 days and can be produced more cheaply ¡X up to 30 percent less expensively. Plus, it gets rid of a source of food waste. That proposition caught the attention of Whirlpool, an early customer, Chi said.At One Ventures is also a backer of Alchemie, which is working on waterless dyeing technology ¡X addressing one of the apparel industry¡¦s biggest pain points at an operational expense that is two times lower than traditional methods; and Dendra Systems, a drone company that can dramatically speed up forest restoration projects (planting 120 seeds per minute) at an ¡§exponentially\" lower cost per hectare.It¡¦s tough to argue with economics like that. ¡§We need to get more of the conversations to this level,¡¨ according to Chi.?While economics will definitely win the day when it comes to scaling climate tech, I don¡¦t think climate techies can afford to sit on the political sidelines when it comes to policies that could make or break our ability to address climate change.??One of my favorite year-end reads was the Dec. 15 column by Robinson Meyer of The Atlantic, examining the best ways to make an impact on climate change (\"A New Estimate of the ¡¥Most Effective¡¦ Way to Fight Climate Change\"). In the article, Meyer discusses the work of Giving Green, which publishes recommendations for where climate-related donations might have the most impact. Its advice: Give to organizations that are helping shape policy, such as Carbon180, Evergreen Collaborative and the Clean Air Task Force.Carbon180 keeps close tabs on U.S. federal policy related to carbon removal, and was at the center of advocacy work for many of the research and development policies that showed up in the bipartisan Infrastructure bill that actually passed Congress this year. Clean Air Task Force is focused on hard-to-abate sectors, and was at the center of fighting for the Global Methane Pledge announced at COP26. The Evergreen Collaborative was born out of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee¡¦s presidential campaign, and it has been at the center of advocacy work for Build Back Better. Even though that legislation is still languishing, Evergreen has been one of the biggest proponents for the Clean Electricity Performance Program, which would shape a series of grid decarbonization investments.What does this mean for climate tech startups or for corporations seeking to make climate tech investments? It starts with simply understanding how your company¡¦s policy agenda intersects with action on climate change. I found it very striking that Spencer Reeder, director of sustainability at Audi of America ¡X one of the first automotive organizations to set an internal price on carbon ¡X is also its director of government affairs. In fact, that¡¦s the first thing listed in his title.?If climate action or sustainability is a pillar of your company¡¦s strategy, you really should be fusing these two disciplines, Reeder told me. \"It¡¦s really important that this shows up consistently,\" he said.Amen to that sentiment.??What¡¦s your climate tech resolution for 2022?

              " '\"The standard American diet kills us slowly in normal times and quickly in COVID times,\" Michael Pollan told Kara Swisher as part of a recent interview for her podcast Sway.?To Pollan, it is clear that people who suffer from preexisting diet-related conditions are more likely to get serious COVID-19 infections. Forty-nine percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 had hypertension, 48 percent were obese and 28 percent suffered from diabetes. He argues that we need to pay more attention to how diets affect health. Directly, they cause non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. As a result of these, people are more vulnerable to illnesses such as COVID-19.?The COVID-related coverage we see in the news and the discussions we have with our friends, families and colleagues might not award the impact healthy diets have on immunity enough attention. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the pandemic is helping to illuminate and propagate the systemic linkages between food, health and wellness. And as an added bonus, much of the progress not only benefits health but also sustainability.There are promising signs across three dimensions that I¡¦ll highlight today. But I¡¦d also like to put a caveat front and center. At least for now, these improvements don¡¦t trickle down to low-income population groups that would benefit most from diet-related improvements.??Before we can overhaul an industry, we have to start thinking about old markets in new ways. Over the past couple of years and increasingly so during the pandemic, the conversation around food security has shifted towards a new concept called nutrition security.?At first look, the standard definition of food security ¡X to have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food ¡X seems to cover all the essential aspects. But when evaluating how food security looks like in policies and food assistance programs, the nutrition aspect often falls short. Quantity, not quality, of food dominates reality. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University, has been one of the most prominent leaders in this field. In Tufts¡¦ coverage of one of his recent papers, he stresses:By reframing food security and putting nutrition front and center, Mozaffarian and others hope to achieve policy and food innovation that will offer foods enabling health, well-being and the prevention and treatment of disease in addition to combating hunger.?The pandemic has also given consumers ample time to rediscover their relationship with food and form new habits. Whether out of necessity or pleasure, many people started cooking more at home and educating themselves on what healthy immunity-strengthening diets look like. Deloitte¡¦s market research suggests that this trend will likely outlive the pandemic ¡X 42 percent of consumers say they plan to continue cooking more food at home.?Home cooking and temporary supermarket supply chain shortages have also strengthened decentralized and local supply chains. Direct-to-consumer models such as farmers¡¦ markets, vegetable boxes from community-supported agriculture and home gardening have flourished during COVID-19. Deloitte¡¦s data suggest that 29 percent of consumers intend to continue buying more fresh foods post-pandemic.?These are encouraging news for innovative platforms trying to tap into these markets. MilkRun is an Oregon-based company that aggregates products from small farms in local hubs and delivers them directly to consumers. Their service launched in the Pacific Northwest and expanded to Austin over the past year. GrownBy is another app connecting farmers directly to consumers, increasing their profits by taking advantage of the COVID-related surge in online ordering.?These new approaches have the potential to improve the health of consumers by bringing fresher, more nutritious products to their fridges while also strengthening food sovereignty.?The venture-capital-backed startup world has also been forging ahead with products at the nutrition and sustainability nexus over the past 18 months. Indoor farming that promises to bring more nutrient-dense products to consumers at a lower environmental cost has continued to grow during the pandemic. Similarly, the alternative protein sector has gained momentum. According to the Good Food Institute, plant-based meat, egg and dairy companies have together raised a staggering 2.2 billion in 2020, more than three times as much compared to 2019.Two health-related developments in the alternative protein sector stand out to me. One is the continued iteration and improvement of established products such as Beyond Meat¡¦s burgers. The company is planning to launch two new versions of its beef patties that will have between 35 to 55 percent less saturated fat than its beef equivalents.?Another is the rise of a new generation of plant-based companies such as Nowadays that have health baked into their DNA. This San Francisco-based startup was founded during the pandemic. Within less than a year, it brought \"clean-label\"?chicken nuggets to market that taste fantastic while only relying on seven ingredients and boosting a superior nutritional profile. As the industry map above shows, Nowadays is part of a thriving ecosystem working to improve personal health and nutrition security.?A recent analysis by S2G Ventures, a multi-stage venture fund investing across food and agriculture supply chains, dives into how pandemics have historically led to structural shifts in the food and agriculture industry. \"For consumers, the pandemic has pushed environmentalism from niche to mainstream which has enabled structural shifts in a very short amount of time,\" Dan Ripma, senior associate at S2G, told me. He and his colleagues are?advising their portfolio companies on how to adjust business tactics to these new frameworks.?Policy innovation is required to scale entrepreneurial approaches for nutrition security, making them accessible to low-income communities that struggle with nutrition security and can¡¦t afford premium products and services. Some developments in the U.S. such as the push for better quality and universal child nutrition programs and President Joe Biden¡¦s backing of a 15 minimum wage for workers are a good start. But based on my read of the nutrition assistance programs that have been strengthened as part of COVID-relief packages, the government¡¦s focus still overwhelmingly lies on emergency hunger relief. While this is a critical support for millions of people right now, it does little to build long-term community health.',\n",
              " 'The concept of a simple circular process that keeps material out of the waste stream is easy to understand and easy to favor. But simple is not easy. Embracing circular economy practices is a complex challenge that encompasses the entire value chain of a product and requires collaboration across the public and private sectors. So, what does it take to move from vision to action in really \"closing the loop\"?At Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), we believe that to create a truly circular product and support truly circular systems, three main steps must be taken:?We have a wide variety of packaging across our portfolio of more than 125 owned, licensed and partner beverage brands ¡X?everything from Dr Pepper soda bottles to Canada Dry sparkling water cans to Keurig K-Cup pods. Some of our products have been mainstays in residential recycling programs for decades, such as aluminum cans and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles, but others are newer to recycling systems, including recyclable polypropylene K-Cup pods. This means we can¡¦t approach designing for the circular economy with a one-size-fits-all mentality.?The path to a circular product starts with material selection, a seemingly simple step that must account for many requirements. For almost all of our packaging, the material first and foremost must be fit for purpose and allow for food-grade contact. This is sort of a no-brainer when thinking about the containers your beverages come in, but that becomes a crucial sticking point when designing for a circular product. It¡¦s not just a question of if the material is recyclable, but can the product make its way through a complex recycling system and be reused as post-consumer recycled (PCR) content??Details are important to answering this question. The colors used and how caps and labels are designed greatly affect how well our packaging can fit into a circular system. As an example, KDP recently switched its A&W root beer and cream soda bottles from amber-colored plastic to clear, as clear plastics warrant more value to recyclers, as they are the most versatile for reuse. Additionally, we¡¦re taking action by expanding the space we allocate to recycling instructions on our bottle labels and other packaging in order to make the act of recycling more visible to our consumers.The next critical stage in ensuring a closed loop for packaging is infrastructure support. There are about 20,000 municipalities in the U.S., with no standardized guidelines on infrastructure or acceptance policies for recycling. This disparate system means that improvements are needed in hundreds of Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) that serve these programs to consistently accept, sort and recycle the range of recyclable products and packages commonly used at home, at work and on the go. Those players that produce large volumes of recyclable materials need to become leaders in ensuring that they can be part of a closed loop system.?Polypropylene plastic ¡X which KDP¡¦s new recyclable K-Cup pods are made from ¡X is labeled as \"check locally\" for recyclability, as select communities do not yet accept or sort for polypropylene, often due to outdated infrastructure. Earlier this year, KDP co-founded The Recycling Partnership¡¦s Polypropylene Recycling Coalition as its largest investor, committing 10 million to improve infrastructure for better, more efficient polypropylene sortation and processing across the country.?Improvements also need to be made to ensure that even commonly accepted materials ¡X such as PET bottles and aluminum cans ¡X can complete a circular journey every time. Current beverage container recycling rates are only less than 30 percent in the U.S. Consumers need to be educated and inspired to recycle bottles and cans with every use, in order to increase the volume of materials that actually get recycled. At the same time, investments are needed to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with infrastructure gaps.?To boost recycling rates and create a stronger supply of quality recycled PET (rPET), KDP invested a collective 100 million alongside its beverage industry peers to fund the American Beverage Association¡¦s Every Bottle Back initiative. The program¡¦s first three grants invested almost 4 million in communities in Texas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, providing upgrades to recycling infrastructure at local MRFs and improvements to recycling programs for hundreds of thousands of households, along with improved consumer education materials to help support \"recycle right\" behaviors.?MRFs need a solid business case to make investments to upgrade their facilities. This often leads to decisions on what they will accept and sort in their facilities based on the market value of the materials they can sell. Commitments from companies to reduce the use of new materials in packaging and instead leverage recycled materials are essential to driving an end-market demand for post-consumer recycled materials ¡X and therefore provide MRFs the economic incentive they need to make upgrades.?When determining how to take the final step in \"closing the loop,\" KDP decided that it wanted to go big, not go home, which is why its first brands to debut with 100 percent recycled plastic bottles were not small, limited edition runs, but the portfolio-wide transition for two of the company¡¦s largest brands.Our team recently announced Snapple is transitioning to 100 percent recycled plastic bottles, along with the CORE brand, which will eliminate the need to make tens of millions of pounds of virgin plastic annually and increase KDP¡¦s demand for and use of post-consumer recycled PET supply. For this latest update, the company is also incorporating even smarter, sustainability-forward design by replacing the brand¡¦s metal caps with plastic ones. While Snapple¡¦s iconic \"pop!\" may go away, this will allow the entire package ¡X bottle and cap ¡X to be recycled, making it a one-step, easier process for consumers to recycle each bottle.KDP set a goal that 30 percent of packaging across its portfolio would be made with PCR materials by 2025 ¡X and the company is right on track to achieve it. Commitments such as these give confidence to MRFs that there will be buyers for their recycled materials if they invest in facility and equipment upgrades, meaning they¡¦ll see solid returns as a result.Snapple\\'s recently unveiled rebrand, with new bottles made from 100 percent recycled plastic. Source: Keurig Dr Pepper.Brands are continuing to strive for circular solutions, as they understand it is the right thing to do for the environment, their business and their consumers. The lesson is that when approaching big problems such as eliminating packaging waste, action must be taken along all stages of the \"loop\" in order to truly close it.',\n",
              " 'If you¡¦ve read our Good Company report, you already know that around 42 percent of Americans want to be seen as someone who buys eco-friendly products, and 26 percent can name a brand ¡X unaided ¡X that they¡¦ve purchased or not purchased because of the environmental or social record of the manufacturer. You also know that how well you¡¦re taking care of your people is what affects Americans¡¦ favorability towards your brand the most.But another clear mandate from consumers is right behind that: recycling. When asked, \"Please choose the three most important things companies should be doing to positively impact your purchase decision,\" \"recycle\" comes out on top, and \"make recyclable products\" rounds out the top three answers.So ¡X why? If you¡¦re reading this, you know that there are much bigger initiatives companies can and should be doing to reduce their environmental impact, so why are Americans fixated on recycling?Three reasons:There¡¦s a huge opportunity for brands to tell their stories ¡X about how you¡¦re managing waste on your factory floors, but also about how you¡¦re working to use packaging materials that genuinely are recyclable. There¡¦s also a high degree of risk here. Until chemical recycling becomes commonplace, any plastics labeled 3-7 largely aren¡¦t being recycled. So when a brand slaps the chasing arrows encircling a number other than a 1 or a 2 on their packaging, they¡¦re really greenwashing, I¡¦m afraid. And when consumers find out, there will be a backlash. They will feel betrayed and lied to. And that¡¦s not the relationship you want to build between your brand and your buyers.',\n",
              " ' Some progress, many disappointments, few surprises. This has been much covered and discussed already. But despite the lack of ambitions and absence of key players, the commitment from progressive businesses and governments has the potential to unleash an unprecedented wave of investments in the global energy transition. ??Any business that plans to be in business 5-10-20-30 years from now needs to tackle this literally burning platform with a completely different sense of urgency. For non-executive directors, this means taking personal leadership and responsibility to support chief executives and their organizations in accelerating their net-zero transformation.The latest Climate Action Tracker, published at COP26, gives us a pretty good idea of what we are heading towards: With current policies, we¡¦re shooting for a 2.7 degrees Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2050. By delivering on the 2030 targets, this will fall to 2.4 degrees C, and by fully implementing all submitted and binding targets we¡¦re heading for a 2.1 degrees C scenario. In the right direction, yes. Yet, we¡¦re still heading for disaster.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we need to keep global warming well below 1.5 degrees C. This half degree will make the difference from bad to catastrophic for billions of people, affecting lives and livelihoods. The past couple of years have already given us a flavor of what is in store: Extreme heat waves; floods; arctic winters; droughts; wildfires; and irreversible changes in the world¡¦s ecosystems ¡X it¡¦s already happening. It¡¦s no surprise that half of all CEOs (49 percent) state that supply chain interruptions due to climate change are among their top risks, according to a recent United Nations Global Compact-Accenture Strategy CEO report, \"Climate Leadership in the Eleventh Hour.\"According to the Climate Action Tracker, the \"glass half-full\" version of the story is that if everyone delivers on their announced targets, we could deliver on a 1.8 degrees C scenario. That¡¦s why the headline board agenda for 2022 should be how to accelerate from commitments to transformational action.Also here the UN Global Compact-Accenture report gives food for thought: Because while more CEOs are committed to taking climate action, they are struggling to accelerate their climate ambitions.Fully 71 percent of CEOs say they are actively working to develop a net-zero emissions target for their company, and 57 percent believe they are operating in line with the 1.5 degrees C goal. Yet as an indicator, only 2 percent of these companies have a formal target validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). In contrast, companies working against science-based targets demonstrate real progress: From 2015 to 2019, SBTI companies collectively reduced their annual CO2 emissions by 25 percent.Scope 1 and 2 that focus on the company¡¦s own operations and the energy supply are not simple, but CEOs find it particularly hard to deliver on Scope 3 of their emission targets. To broaden their net-zero impact throughout their supply chains, they need to work within their ecosystems of change, looking at competitors, policymakers, investors, providers and suppliers as stakeholders and partners. They need to join forces to improve traceability of their collective carbon footprint and agree on new incentive structures and price points to reward their collective progress towards net zero.This is a hugely complex agenda. It bridges planetary, social and economic dimensions. It requires that we rethink leadership, governance and strategy so we create stakeholder value by default. It takes new capabilities and skillsets at the leadership level. At the board level, it starts by asking the right questions and by demonstrating the right level of support of senior management to steer the transformation through. But there is no other way.As you prepare for 2022, how about bringing along the following three questions for your next board meeting:The board has an important role in encouraging management to launch into the?Race to Zero: This is a radical and transformational innovation agenda that needs full support and attention from every executive and non-executive director.',\n",
              " 'While the climate crisis has the attention of many businesses around the world, there¡¦s less awareness about the private sector¡¦s relationship to nature. A recent study found that over half the global gross domestic product, worth 44 trillion, is at risk due to the loss of nature.Further, a key strategy for addressing climate change is the protection of nature and its diversity. Unfortunately, natural ecosystems that are the most effective at storing carbon are also the most at risk of being lost due to unsustainable practices.These facts alone should spur businesses to look closely at the connection their business has to biodiversity and how to preserve it. Although biodiversity protection is a nascent topic for corporate action, we may be at a turning point, especially as the world¡¦s governments continue to deliberate policies.National leaders from across the globe are negotiating a set of goals and targets, the Global Biodiversity Framework, that will guide sustainable use and environmental protection commitments, management and governance decisions for the next decade. One of the Framework¡¦s key proposed targets aims to protect one-third of the Earth¡¦s lands and seas. The Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) is translating how companies can contribute to these aims and meet planetary boundaries through its \"Science-Based Targets for Nature Initial Guidance for Business.\"? Companies are piloting this data-driven approach to develop targets that aim to protect and restore nature.To begin taking action to protect biodiversity, similar to climate goals, companies need to start by understanding their impact, hotspots and improvement opportunities for biodiversity. The SBTN initial guidance points to first leveraging industry-level assessments and existing company assessments to see what nature topics emerge. This is followed by deeper exploration which may leverage a lifecycle assessment, water risk assessment, and additional issues such as:A unique aspect of biodiversity and nature assessments, as compared to climate assessments, is that they include consideration of the actual geographies that are affected and the health and quality of nature at the location of the company¡¦s activities. For example, the large-scale Topaz solar farm is in California¡¦s Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot with unique species and ecosystems. Because of this special environmental location, the company has developed pre- and post-construction monitoring of the grassland habitat to ensure that their solar energy production and land use is responsible and that it also helps enhance biodiversity and protection of native wildlife at the site.During the assessment phase, it¡¦s important to look at a range of issues across the value chain including operational, upstream and downstream activities. This involves a review of the biodiversity that is affected by the extraction or production of the materials used in the business. For example, L\\'Or?al, a corporate member of SBTN, sources around 1,600 raw materials for their products from nearly 350 plant species; while most of their plant-based ingredients are already sustainably?sourced, their assessment of these raw materials led to their aim to reach 100 percent sustainable sourcing by 2030 and limit their land occupancy to 2019 levels as a means to protect biodiversity.Following the assessment phase, businesses can use the understanding of impacts, hotspots and improvement opportunities to define which priorities to address and then set goals. Applying common best practices when developing goals (SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,?Time-Bound; engaging stakeholder input, and so on) can ensure that biodiversity goals are easier to track and achieve. At this stage where metrics are being defined, a better baseline than was used for the assessment phase may need to be established to inform the goals and outline a clear plan.Some companies provide useful examples for goal-setting, such as L¡¦Or?al, which has agreed on three goals for biodiversity, the first noted above plus limiting impact on natural habitats and by 2030, 100 percent of industrial sites and all operated buildings will have a positive impact on biodiversity, compared to 2019.Similarly, Kering has defined their approach to achieve net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025 by developing measurable biodiversity goals. These timebound goals include spatial metrics: Regenerating and protecting an area around six times the total land footprint of Kering¡¦s entire supply chain, all the way back to raw material production; convert 2.47 million acres of farms and rangelands in its supply chain landscapes into regenerative agriculture; and protect an additional 1.47 million acres of critical, \"irreplaceable\"?habitat outside of its supply chain through programs that support biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration?and livelihood improvements.Finally, making effective progress requires the integration of biodiversity factors into core business practices as well as collaborating externally. These include establishing policies, developing guidance and tracking progress.In executing its commitment to regenerative agriculture, Danone established regenerative pillars with specific expectations defined to engage its suppliers and survey their actions. PepsiCo has a similar approach through its Sustainable Farming Program to spread regenerative farming practices across 7 million acres, about equal to its entire agricultural footprint. The company reviewed progress across the full supply chain in over 60 countries and engaged with stakeholders to make an impact.To implement their biodiversity goals, some companies are finding strength in collaboration, joining efforts such as members of the Fashion Pact where over 60 organizations from the fashion and textile industry have committed to restoring biodiversity as a part of their business operations. Another example includes the Forest Positive Coalition of the Consumer Goods Forum, which works with companies whose collective ambition to remove commodity-driven deforestation from supply chains is guided by agreed measures that are reported and tracked. There is also the CEO-led One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) effort which has a specific focus on regenerative agriculture and advocacy opportunities through the Business for Nature coalition.In addition to learning from the businesses and examples noted above, the Pure Strategies free self-assessment tool on science-based targets for nature can help companies identify areas they can leverage for protecting and restoring biodiversity and how to take next steps.This isn¡¦t just a critical time for the planet and humanity, but also an encouraging time. We are at the beginning of the pivotal point where companies are understanding the importance of nature to their business and starting to take meaningful action. No matter where your company is on that journey, there are opportunities and benefits for advancing sustainable strategies that include your business and biodiversity.',\n",
              " 'All companies with business operations or supply chains in Vietnam need to know that the country is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change ¡X and need to be aware of the ways they can build resilience.In October, two mega-typhoons flooded communities, displaced families and took lives in what is becoming an all too familiar pattern. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world\\'s areas most affected by climate variability and extreme weather in the past two decades, according to The Global Climate Risk Index 2020.The financial impacts from climate change are also severe in Vietnam. Infrastructure disruptions from climate change cost businesses in Vietnam an average of 280 million each year.Heavy rainfall can lead to flooding and landslides, shutting down roads and airports while damaging or destroying company facilities. Major storms such as Typhoon Damrey in 2017 left an estimated 1 billion in economic losses for Vietnam.?In 2020, business interruptions from climate change affected thousands of local enterprises due to manpower shortages, scarce input material supplies or damage to facilities.?Climate projections indicate Vietnam will experience more intense extreme weather events in the future. By 2030, major cities such as Ho Chi Minh could experience an increased chance of extreme heatwaves, diminishing worker productivity in sectors from agriculture to construction to logistics.Hanoi could experience heavier rainfall, straining urban wastewater systems and exposing coastal development to storm surges. The implications are wide-ranging, from increasing pest prevalence that limit crop yields to worsening the spread of vector-borne disease to deepening the economic hardship of at-risk communities.Fortunately, there are ways businesses in Vietnam can reduce their climate risk. To better prepare for the reality of climate change, businesses can build resilience: to anticipate, absorb, accommodate and recover from relevant impacts. To do this, companies need to systematically explore where and how the business environment may change in the future. Scenario analysis is a commonly used process to explore different plausible futures. This tool allows companies to \"stress-test\" strategies and ensure adequate preparation for a range of potential outcomes.For businesses in Vietnam, BSR has crafted three scenarios in English and in Vietnamese, describing plausible future business environments in 2030, that differ on climate severity and socioeconomic development. The physical impacts from climate change are inevitable and may vary. Layered on top of that, there will be interconnected impacts from a potential transition to a low-carbon economy as well as socioeconomic developments. These three scenarios explore different plausible futures:These three scenarios are not predictions of the future in 2030. Rather, they are tools that can be used to explore critical uncertainties about the future, challenge assumptions and identify blind spots related to disruptive change. They are meant for companies to use in internal workshop settings, where key participants from diverse business functions can discuss risks and opportunities that arise from climate change and prioritize core topics for appropriate action.In this scenario analysis exercise, for example, workshop participants could imagine linkages between prolonged dry spells and food availability and the direct impact these may have, not just on the bottom line but also on employee well-being.Or a business could explore the impact of supply chain disruptions due to submerged road networks and also consider blind spots from a resurgence of infectious diseases that thrives in warmer climates. After more than a year in the \"black swan event\" that is COVID-19, companies cannot avoid discussions of preparing for shocks to the system.From here, enterprises can decide how to leverage a range of risk interventions to address impacts from climate change and find new opportunities for business growth ¡X from offering disaster risk reduction training to employees and enhancing employee health coverage, to investing in both green and gray infrastructure to climate-proof facilities, to offering new products or services that can help others build climate resilience.It¡¦s undeniable that climate change negatively affects Vietnamese businesses. However, most companies are relatively optimistic about opportunities in the context of natural disaster risk and climate change, according to an Asia Foundation survey conducted in August of more than 10,000 enterprises across the country. They see opportunities for restructuring, overhauling production methods and creating new markets for products and services. They are willing to invest in environmental compliance, good local labor quality and vocational education for their workforce.Actively enhancing climate resilience would meaningfully build off this energy and prepare businesses and the communities they operate in for addressing the complex challenges of climate change.BSR conducted this project in collaboration with Winrock International¡¦s Private Investment for Enhanced Resilience (PIER) project, which aims to increase the awareness and capability of the private sector in Vietnam to address the physical impacts of climate change across the value chain in the country.',\n",
              " 'One of the important next steps for business leadership to take on climate change, especially in the wake of COP26, is to think through how to engage their customers on climate. Climate action costs money, so pioneers risk being disadvantaged ¡X unless they can learn how to create value from their climate leadership. Unlocking this value is not just a commercial business opportunity; it is a vital enabler of climate action at scale.For companies serving corporate customers, the routes to commercial value are relatively clear. Corporate customers are pursuing their own climate transition efforts, creating opportunities to help them through differentiated products that decarbonize their supply chain ¡X through joint problem-solving efforts that deepen the customer relationship or through playing new roles as value migrates along the chain.Companies serving consumers have found the challenge much harder. The opportunity looks attractive: Research consistently shows that as individuals, we care a lot about climate change, and we say that we are happy to pay more for sustainable options. Yet many companies have stories of climate-friendly products and services they have launched that have had next to no take-up. And consumers remain mostly unaware, and unengaged, with the climate efforts companies are making.This is not a failure of individuals; this is a failure of companies to figure out how climate leadership translates into value.Climate change has become a mainstream concern. Today, 26 percent of people in the United States are \"alarmed\" by climate change and strongly support immediate action to address it ¡X up from 11 percent just eight years ago, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Across the globe, people want to be part of the solution and say they are willing to pay more for it, we found in a recent survey (Chart 1).Chart 1: Stated willingness to payA substantial majority of people across countries say they are willing to pay for sustainability\"Are you willing to pay a premium for sustainable products and services? If yes, how much?\"Source: Oliver Wyman Forum 2021. N = 3,500.Early attempts to turn this interest into value followed a \"build it and they will come\" logic. Banks built \"green mortgages,\" energy companies offered \"green tariffs,\" travel came with an option to offset. Most of these attempts failed to scale. One airline, for example, found that three years after launch, only 3 percent of passengers chose to pay the 2.70 to offset their flight emissions.Today, companies are shifting their efforts from the product level to the brand and company level, recognizing that consumers expect brands to commit without them having to pay for it. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development¡¦s (WBCSD) Vision 2050 report \"Time to transform\" describes this as \"making all choices good choices.\" It takes a proactive effort. As Roberta Barbieri, vice president of global sustainability at PepsiCo, puts it: \"We can¡¦t simply rely on consumer behavior to dictate how fast the industry evolves ¡X it¡¦s on corporations like ours to drive these changes.\"The brand-level approach can work ¡X for consumer, company and climate. Customers connect with brands that they see acting on climate, and love them for it, as we have shown in our Brand Aperture research. The correlation between people believing that a brand is doing everything it should on climate change, and saying they love that brand, is consistently high: 65 percent in the United States, 63 percent in the U.K., 58 percent in China, in our research covering 300 brands across the three markets.Chart 2: Climate action and brand connectionHigh correlation between \"I believe that this brand is doing everything they should to help fight climate change\" and \"I love this brand\"Source: Lippincott Brand Aperture 2021The challenge companies face is in getting consumers to recognize, connect with and value their efforts. We offer three tactics that we see achieving this in our work.Many brands are talking sustainability; few cut through. Less than 15 percent of United Kingdom consumers say they know what their favorite brands are doing on sustainability, and this includes some real leaders. At a time when so many companies are taking action and wanting to be seen doing so, the bar for recognition is high.DPDgroup, the European parcel delivery company, is advanced both in the ambition of its climate targets and in its real-world progress. In 2020, DPD delivered more than 10 million parcels with electric vehicles, for example, up from 1 million the previous year. The company is recognized as a sustainability leader by sustainability ratings company EcoVadis and the environmental disclosure nonprofit CDP. Yet in our research, only 5 percent of consumers using DPD say they know what the brand is doing to fight climate change and only 3 percent see it as a leader in this space.In fact, in the U.K., we found only one brand (out of 100 tested) for whom most of its consumers said they know what the brand is doing to fight climate change: Tesla.When brands talk sustainability, it is often about what the company is doing. When people talk sustainability, it is all about what we should be doing. Rationally, we could have the most impact by using our collective purchasing power and voting power to influence the actions of corporations and governments at scale. But what consumers are looking for is something more personal and direct, focused on reducing their own carbon footprint. We call this the \"Me\" bias (Chart 3).Chart 3: The \"Me\" bias\"The biggest contribution I can make on sustainability is to reduce my own carbon footprint.\"Source: Lippincott Brand Aperture 2021This \"Me\" bias drives customers to discount companies¡¦ sustainability efforts. It¡¦s not that they don¡¦t care; they just don¡¦t see the relevance to their day-to-day lives.Microsoft has one of the world¡¦s boldest emissions reduction efforts and commitments, using internal carbon pricing that directly costs their operating businesses and uniquely committing to remove all historical carbon emissions by 2050. There is no role for the customer in their announcement, it¡¦s simply a thing Microsoft is doing about Microsoft¡¦s emissions. Yet only 14 percent of their U.S. consumers in our research see them leading their industry in fighting climate change.Ant Group, by contrast, focuses on the personal carbon footprint. Their Ant Forest initiative, launched in 2016, allows consumers to collect green energy points from choosing sustainable options and convert them into planting trees. Research shows 57 percent of their consumers in China see them as a climate leader.Climate action is famously urgent, yet the timeframes of companies¡¦ climate commitments are extraordinarily long. In what other context do companies make projections for 2050 or talk of 2030 as an interim milestone? With frequent news stories of how the world is not on track in its emissions reductions, it is no surprise if consumers are skeptical. The result is that consumers under-value commitments for the future ¡X which are the bulk of most companies¡¦ climate efforts ¡X and over-value action today. We call this the \"Now\" bias (Chart 4):Chart 4: The \"Now\" bias\"I don¡¦t trust the ¡¥commitments¡¦ that companies make about climate change; what matters is what they are doing now.\"Source: Lippincott Brand Aperture?2021The combination of the \"Me\" and \"Now\" biases drives some potentially unhelpful results. We tested three climate narratives that a bank could tell, using actual language from banks¡¦ websites: a net-zero commitment, focusing on defunding fossil fuels; a transition-finance commitment, at the scale of 1 trillion; and offering non-plastic, eco-friendly bank cards. What people most valued were the eco-friendly cards.Our point is not to focus on tokenistic crowd-pleasers. It is that to cut through to consumers and work with their \"Me\" and \"Now\" biases, the key is to show them how they themselves can do something more sustainably, today. With Tesla, I can drive more sustainably today. With Alipay, I can shop more sustainably today. Brands that can channel their climate actions into a meaningful customer-centered proposition like that, can deliver for the consumer, the company and the climate.',\n",
              " 'When you think of Colgate-Palmolive, the first thing likely to come to mind is its eponymous toothpaste or dish soap. But the company also owns a lot of other brands that offer other consumer packaged goods such as deodorant (Speed Stick), body soap (Irish Spring) and other household cleaning products (Fabuloso).And what are those items packaged in? Most of the time, plastic. The company was the eighth biggest plastic polluter in 2019, according to the Changing Markets Foundation. But it recently made a commitment to eliminate a substantial chunk of its plastic waste by 2025.?Back in November, Colgate-Palmolive released details about its 2025 strategy, which centers on three key areas and a few goals with longer-term trajectories. Among areas it\\'s planning to address is preserving the environment. The commitment to eliminate one-third of its plastic waste by 2025 is part of its \"preserve the environment\" ambition, and it¡¦s part of a goal that also includes transitioning to 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable plastic packaging by the same year.Shortly after the 2025 strategy¡¦s publication, I spoke with Ann Tracy, chief sustainability officer at Colgate-Palmolive, about the specific commitments, how the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on its sustainability goals and why it held firm with the release schedule for the company\\'s recyclable toothpaste tube.\"We didn\\'t slow down the implementation of our new recyclable tube,\" Tracy said. \"We\\'re continuing to invest and put even more resources, even hiring some resources around the plastic waste issue.\"Here are three other major takeaways from our conversation.1. Its plastic strategy focuses on three areas. Those areas are the possibility of using new materials; moving its packaging to be 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable; and developing other ways to deliver its products with potentially less packaging.For example, it\\'s exploring whether toothpaste really needs to be in a tube. \"If you think about toothpaste, can it be in a different format other than paste to deliver the same, clean benefits for your oral health? So, can it be tablets? Can it be chewable?\" Tracy said. \"Things like cleaning products that are a little tablet that you just drop into a reusable container and add water so that it\\'s reducing the overall environmental footprint. Those are examples.¡¨ As of September, the company was testing a tablet cleaning product with its PLOOF Ajax line in France, according to a LinkedIn post from Greg P. Corra, director of packaging innovation and sustainability at Colgate-Palmolive.Companies already are taking a similar approach. For toothpaste, there\\'s Bite, Lush and Hello. For cleaning products, there\\'s Blueland, Seventh Generation and Amazon\\'s in-house product line Clean Revolution.Additionally, Tracy said, the company is studying what role it should play in driving better recycling infrastructure around the world. \"Different countries have different levels of infrastructure. The U.S. itself, although we\\'re considered a developed country, we have a very disparate system.\" In late June, Colgate-Palmolive was part of a group of consumer brands and corporate foundations to invest 54 million with Closed Loop Partners\\' infrastructure fund to \"support additional recycling infrastructure and spur growth and technological innovation around end markets for post-consumer materials across North America.\"?2. The company is aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in its global operations by 2040. To achieve this, Colgate-Palmolive has set goals that will build up to this one. One goal is to source 100 percent renewable electricity in its operations by 2030.¡§I like to call it the cousin target,¡¨ Tracy said, noting that the company recently launched its process to get to 100 percent renewable energy by engaging with its operations around the world. Colgate operates in more than 80 countries, with its headquarters in New York City and six divisions around the world including in Latin America, Europe and Asia. It has more than 50 manufacturing and research facilities globally and in 2019, it made 15.7 billion of worldwide net sales, according to the company\\'s website.To source the renewable electricity, Colgate plans to implement a multi-pronged strategy: buying green power; building solar farms; and negotiating power purchase agreements.?Tracy said Colgate is still working with outside partners to help it build a plan for how to get to net-zero carbon by 2040 but noted that the company considers purchasing offsets to be the last resort on its decarbonization journey.?\"We don\\'t have a strategy around offsets yet other than we do believe they will play a role to close gaps at the end, but that\\'s what we consider them ¡X? a gap closer, not a leading technology,\" she said. \"We\\'d like to see the offsets become a bit more standardized and accepted before we start building our strategy around that.\"The company is also accessing how to address its Scope 3 emissions and beginning to work with its tier one suppliers to help \"extend the carbon footprint reduction beyond its own supply chain.\"3. Its recyclable toothpaste tube took a lot of partnership ¡X and will continue to. Tracy said the company developed a roadmap to convert every single tube it makes to the recyclable tube format over the next couple of years. During the first quarter of 2020, it launched its first recyclable toothpaste tubes with its Tom\\'s of Maine and Smile for Good lines.Colgate-Palmolive makes most of its own toothpaste tubes internally. To give a sense of how many toothpaste tubes it sells worldwide, in 2019, the Colgate toothpaste brand sold almost 80 million units in the United States, according to data on Statista.\"It takes a lot of investment because we have to convert all our equipment,\" she said. \"I like to say half the job was the engineering and the technology to develop the tube, but the other half of the job was to work with the local recycling infrastructure to make sure it\\'s accepted into the mainstream. It takes a lot of partners.\"?Right now, Tracy said, the company is \"busy ramping up the Optic White line in the U.S., which is one of our biggest lines of toothpaste or brands of toothpaste in the U.S. So, we\\'re launching that very shortly here along with all our kids\\' toothpaste in the U.S.\"?She added that, in Europe, by the end of 2021, 80 percent of the tubes will be converted to the recyclable version. Colgate-Palmolive hopes to eventually convert all its tubes. It¡¦s still early days for this effort, so the company doesn¡¦t have many more learnings to share at this point but Tracy said it wants to make sure all its tubes are actually recycled.\"Until we have scale, until other tubes convert to this recyclable technology, technically it\\'s not recycled,\" Tracy said. \"We\\'re working very hard with partners to make sure it\\'s accepted into the recycling industry.\"Its partners include Recycling Partnership and the American Plastic Recycling Association, who are helping with its plastic waste reduction efforts.\"We had to work with them to get the tube accepted and make sure it was recognized as recyclable,\" Tracy said. \"We could not have done this work without external partners, absolutely not.\"',\n",
              " 'Regular readers of Energy Weekly know Energy Efficiency Day is one of my favorite holidays. Sure, it¡¦s less flashy than National Donut Day or May the Fourth, but its understated brilliance perfectly mirrors the quiet significance of energy efficiency itself. After all, as a Jew I celebrate Hanukkah ¡X a holiday literally celebrating the miracle of energy efficiency ¡X over Christmas, a day often associated with overconsumption.?I also like an underdog. Energy efficiency continues to be the cheapest and fastest way to decarbonize and meet our energy demands, yet it still gets far less airtime than its clean energy counterparts.?So humble!?This year, I invite you to reflect on three things energy efficiency could do, were its inner Hulk unleashed:At its core, energy efficiency means using resources more wisely. Efficient homes are more comfortable and more affordable.?That could go a long way to support low-income homes and communities of color who have a disproportionate energy burden. As a percentage of their income, Black households pay upwards of threefold more than white households for energy. They¡¦re also disproportionately affected by utility shut-off policies, leaving them more vulnerable to dangerously hot and cold days.?Unfortunately, these communities don¡¦t have equal access to energy efficiency. The root causes are complex and, as outlined in a half-day summit on equity and energy efficiency organized by Woman of Color Collective in Sustainability, include:As electricity demands increase with more electric buildings, electric cars and air conditioners in a warming world, energy efficiency can relieve pressure on our strained electricity grid.?For example, a recent heatwave in California resulted in the state¡¦s first rolling blackouts since the Enron scandal in 2001. While there were multiple factors, energy experts generally agree it could have been avoided through demand response ¡X energy efficiency¡¦s cousin that shifts consumption to better match energy supply, which I feel comfortable generally lumping together.According to a recent report out from Oracle Opower, its energy efficiency programs have shaved 25 terawatt-hours of energy ¡X the equivalent of four coal plants per year. As utilities move towards 2050 net-zero goals, energy efficiency is more than a tool to save money; it¡¦s a necessary component of reaching climate goals.?Further, distributed energy resources will go a lot further if they are powering energy-efficient buildings and appliances. As one energy efficiency expert from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory put it to me, \"energy efficiency is the stake; renewables are the sizzle.\" The value proposition for, say, onsite solar panels, makes a lot more sense if they are powering something efficient. And that makes a difference with the rise in power outages across the nation.?As air conditioners became a huge energy suck with everyone at home over the summer, COVID 19 is expected to bring higher heating bills this winter.?With millions of people still working and attending school from home, coupled with forecasts of a colder winter than last year, demand for heating fuels will be up ¡X as will their cost, according to the Energy Information Administration.?Indoor climate control is expensive. According to the U.S Department of Energy, space heating accounts for almost half of a home¡¦s energy bill, and older homes are the worst culprits. Homes built before 1950 use about 60 percent more energy per square foot than those built in the 21st century.?With everyone hunkering at home, energy demand and bills have been on the rise already. My home¡¦s energy bill almost doubled. Even before COVID and energy price volatility, the DOE found energy efficiency measures reduced energy bills by 25 percent on average.?With all of the economic uncertainty right now, who wouldn¡¦t want that?',\n",
              " '2020 undeniably brought the \"S\" pillar of ESG into greater focus, including issues such as employee wellness, human rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. But investors didn¡¦t exactly ignore the \"E\" component and are poised to emphasize it even more in 2021 and beyond, according to a recent Conference Board corporate sustainability disclosure analysis.In fact, three environmental issues ¡X climate risks, water risks and biodiversity impacts ¡X are poised to be in sharp focus this year for investors, and companies should prepare. Here are three ways sustainability executives can anticipate investor requests on each issue.1. Strengthen climate risk disclosures by replacing boilerplate text with specific risks and opportunities. As more companies include climate risks in financial disclosures, investors will turn their focus to the content and quality of those disclosures.The Conference Board finds that the number of S&P Global 1200 companies referencing climate risks in their financial reports has more than doubled in the past five years. Almost half (44 percent) of global companies?include these risks in their 10-Ks or equivalent reports.Investor pressure on companies to report climate risks ¡X and investors¡¦ backing of reporting frameworks such as the one recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) ¡X have been key drivers of the uptick in climate disclosure.Regulatory initiatives are also playing a big role in spurring disclosure. The EU Taxonomy, for example, requires certain financial institutions to make climate risk disclosures by the end of this year. This regulation already has an impact: Companies in the financial sector had the greatest uptick in climate risk disclosure, with almost half of financial companies (47 percent) disclosing these risks in 2020, up from 31 percent in 2019.As climate risk disclosure becomes more prevalent, companies should anticipate investors will scrutinize their content. A recent report by The Conference Board and Datamaran found most climate risk disclosures remain general and lack mention of specific risks and opportunities. To prepare for this increased scrutiny companies should examine their current climate disclosures and consider replacing boilerplate text with more specifics, including physical impacts or transition impacts related to climate change.2. Assess your exposure to water risks and prepare to report on them.For companies in certain industries, it is not a question of if but when water crises will cause major disruptions.But awareness of these risks has not translated into much action ¡X water crises have been listed by the World Economic Forum as a top five global risk in each of the last nine years, yet few companies publicly disclose their water risks.Indeed, BlackRock has labeled water risks as \"under-reported,\" and The Conference Board analysis confirms disclosure levels are low across most sectors.For example, fewer than one in 10 companies report their water stress exposure (which refers to the percentage of freshwater withdrawn in regions with high baseline water stress).There are signs that disclosure activity is picking up in some sectors, however. One-third of companies in the materials sector, for example, disclose their water stress exposure, up from 7 percent in 2019. The energy sector also saw disclosure rates more than triple in one year.Investor-focused reporting frameworks are clearly having an impact on disclosure: Both the Sustainabiity Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and TCFD include water stress exposure as a significant metric for companies in the materials and energy sectors. Companies that have not already done so should assess their exposure to water risks and prepare to report on them. Their competitors are increasingly doing so, and investors are paying attention.?3. Take a fresh look at your biodiversity initiatives and examine your value chain for \"hidden\" impacts.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the interconnection between environmental health and public health. Among other things, the pandemic has reminded us that biodiversity-loss increases the risk of infectious diseases. As a result, companies should expect greater urgency for biodiversity-protection efforts.There is already evidence investors are paying more attention to biodiversity issues: The topic hit headlines in the U.S. last year when nearly 70 percent of P&G¡¦s shareholders voted \"yes\" on a resolution aimed at addressing deforestation in the supply chain.This issue is likely to feature again in this year¡¦s proxy season as investors are keen to understand how companies are managing their biodiversity impacts. Sustainability executives should also keep an eye on developments related to the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosure recommendations, an initiative modeled after the TCFD recommendations.?The time is right for companies to examine (or re-examine) their biodiversity impacts. Just over one-third (35 percent) of global companies have published a biodiversity policy, yet the number of companies exposed to such risks is likely much higher. Companies that may seem safe from these risks, such as those in the services sector, should take a fresh look at their value chains ¡X doing so may reveal significant biodiversity impacts.Last year¡¦s proxy season demonstrated that the crises of 2020 did not distract investors from the \"E\" pillar of ESG. Instead, support for shareholder proposals on environmental issues is at an all-time high: Last year these proposals received an average of 32 percent of votes cast ¡X almost double the support they garnered five years ago.As companies prepare for this year¡¦s proxy season, they should pay close attention to their efforts on climate, water and biodiversity. Companies that have not prepared disclosures in these areas should consider the materiality of these impacts to their business. And for those companies that currently have disclosures in these areas, now is a good time to assess the content and quality of those disclosures.',\n",
              " 'Last week, I unpacked three hype-worthy trends shaping our food systems. Now I want to shine a light on three behind-the-scenes forces that aren¡¦t generating headlines but should be. Let¡¦s drive straight in.The story: Online marketplaces that connect consumers with small-scale producers have boomed during the pandemic. Membership at Crowd Cow, a marketplace for craft meat and seafood, doubled in April alone. Thrive Market ¡X tagline \"healthy living made easy\" ¡X hit 1 million members in November following a roughly?50 percent jump this year.The backstory: This is good news from a sustainability perspective, because both companies provide additional sales channels for producers that practice organic and regenerative agriculture. They¡¦re also using zero-waste commitments and new packaging technology to aggressively tackle the delivery sector¡¦s waste problems.These achievements make me hope these companies prosper, but I¡¦m unnerved at the fragmentation of food retail they represent. We¡¦re seeing a surge in new sales channels that allow relatively wealthy consumers to make healthy and sustainable choices, but nothing like the same momentum elsewhere in the market. Convenience and dollar outlets remain the only food outlets in many low-income neighborhoods.?This is a (sadly familiar) failure of social justice. It¡¦s also a problem for sustainability. We can¡¦t create the food system we need ¡X one that¡¦s low-carbon and biodiversity-enhancing ¡X if only one tier of that system delivers those benefits.?The story: Amazon disrupted retail by creating a marketplace for all sellers. Now something similar is happening in the restaurant industry, where a company named REEF is setting up and running kitchens in parking lots, which restaurants use to fulfill take-out orders. The restaurant specifies the recipe, REEF creates the dishes, and a delivery service (say DoorDash or Uber Eats) gets the meal to your maw.The backstory: This trend will bring changes both good and bad to the dining sector. I want to make the case that this consolidation of takeout infrastructure is also potentially a big deal for sustainability.?U.S. restaurants throw away more than 10 billion of tons of food every year, one reason why 6 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food waste. One solution is to deploy a food waste tracking technology, such as Leanpath. That can be a challenge for small restaurants, but it makes more sense for a centralized operation such as REEF, which just raised 700 million.REEF¡¦s hyper-local approach also lends itself to cargo bike deliveries. Although the company declined a request to discuss its broader sustainability strategy, it is experimenting with bikes: In May, it announced a pilot with delivery firm DHL that involves four electric bikes in the company¡¦s hometown of Miami.The story: Kapor Capital and the Emerson Collective are among the funders behind Planet FWD, maker of Moonshot, a new climate-friendly snack brand.The backstory: Why have a bunch of well-known Silicon Valley investors backed a company that sells crackers? Well, Moonshot is a real product, but Planet FWD¡¦s raison d¡¦?tre is actually the software the company used to source ingredients for its snacks. The tool allows food brands to easily identify ingredients that meet key sustainability metrics, including low emissions. Rivals in this space include Latis and Journey Foods.?This kind of digital infrastructure is invisible to anyone outside of the food business, but until recently it¡¦s been a missing piece of the sustainability jigsaw. Large retailers and brands can pressure suppliers to discuss environmental metrics, but smaller companies and startups don¡¦t have the leverage. As a result, comparing the sustainability bona fides of different ingredients becomes very time-consuming. By solving this problem, services such as Planet FWD will act as an accelerant, allowing brands with ideas for new sustainable foods to get to market much quicker.?This article was adapted from the GreenBiz Food Weekly newsletter.

              " 'The world produces more than enough food to feed the people living on it. But about 690 million people worldwide still went hungry in the last year. And an estimated 1.3 billion metric tons of food?¡X about one-third of all the food produced for human consumption ¡X is lost or wasted globally each year, according to the United Nations.In economic terms, there¡¦s massive demand. There¡¦s abundant supply. But our current food system is unable to connect the two.\"The system has to change,\" Dame Ellen MacArthur, internationally renowned sailor and sustainability expert, said on the virtual stage at GreenBiz Group¡¦s circular economy conference, Circularity 20, in late August.A circular food economy could be the answer. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a circular food economy produces organic, healthy food using natural, regenerative, soil-supporting growing practices. Any byproducts or waste can create additional new food, fabrics or bioenergy inputs. The resources of local ecosystems can be used to feed their communities.The COVID-19 crisis has shown just how necessary a better food system is. The pandemic and subsequent economic shutdowns have upended global food supply chains. But at Circularity 20, companies showed that they were already pushing for progress on the circular economy. MacArthur noted that she¡¦s already seen how businesses are pushing for progress on a circular economy, now more than ever.\"This is something that¡¦s moved phenomenally quickly in the last five years, and I think that¡¦s because it has to,\" she said. \"The brands know it has to.\"Here are three ways companies are helping accelerate circularity in our food system at this moment.1. Prevent food waste at the farm level by working with growersAmid the pandemic, millions of children aren¡¦t able to receive the free lunches at school they may need, employees are working from home and don¡¦t get meals in corporate cafeterias, and restaurants cannot serve as many people because they¡¦re operating at smaller capacities.That has meant a dearth in buyers for farmers ¡X who are still growing and harvesting their crops. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, which represents small farms and ranches, released a report in late March that projected these small growers could face a decline in sales of as much as 688.7 million.?That¡¦s because their perishable surpluses are cheaper to discard than to figure out how to store, ship and sell. Unfortunately, this isn¡¦t a unique situation during the pandemic ¡X it happens frequently during every growing season.?But food waste organizations are intervening to prevent this food from being wasted before it ends up in the landfill. FarmLink Project, for example, has been able to save 10 million pounds of produce from being wasted on farms and diverting them instead to food banks and communities.\"Farmers don¡¦t want to be burying their food,\" said Aidan Reilly, founder of the FarmLink Project, during a Circularity 20 session about fighting food waste during the pandemic. \"They especially don¡¦t want to be paying to bury their food. Many times, they can get insurance, but they still have to pay landfill fees or taxes or regulations.\"An external organization such as FarmLink reaches out to both farm owners who have lost out on contracts amid the pandemic, and to food banks nearby that are facing increasing demand for their services. Then, the organization uses donations to cover the costs of the harvest, pays the farm workers to pack up the extra food, and arranges for drivers to deliver the loads from the fields to the food banks.\"It¡¦s an issue of convenience and timing for the farmer,\" he said. \"That¡¦s where we can come in.\"The impact COVID has had on this space is that it has really just highlighted this issue, and brought it back to the forefront. At the same time, it has created an incentive and an openness and willingness to try to fix the problem.\"2. Work with governments to create resilient local food systemsThe pandemic has shown that local communities are more important than ever. In the absence of national leadership to fight the spread of the disease, much of the work has fallen to local governments.Local governments have had to encourage residents to stay home to stop the spread of the disease, while still ensuring that they aren¡¦t going hungry if they need to stay home and not go to work.?Zeb McLaurin, director of sustainability at Atlanta-based food recovery startup Goodr, spoke at Circularity 20 about how his organization has used government partnerships during the pandemic to collaborate and create a more resilient circular food system on a community scale.Having local growers provide food for their communities means less transportation time, which helps keep produce fresher for longer, extending its value for consumers.McLaurin said the pandemic offered Goodr the opportunity to receive contracts with city and county governments to help feed people. \"We have always wanted to help as a government aid,\" he explained. \"Preparation met opportunity when COVID struck.\"?He added that his organization also has been approached by local governments asking for help creating composting systems ¡X such as building anaerobic digesters ¡X a key part of managing the waste of a circular food economy.3. Leverage emerging technologyScaling circular practices in food systems isn¡¦t an easy task. But new technologies on display at the circular economy conference have the potential to help companies and communities.Technologies such as blockchain can be used for supply chain transparency, so that decision-makers and consumers know more about where food comes from and the regenerative practices that were used to grow it.Other technologies such as smart-design labelling can show exactly when food spoils to prevent edible food from being thrown out. One startup presented this technology during Circularity 20¡¦s startup pitch competition, Accelerate. The company, Mimica, created a label called Mimica Touch. Consumers run their fingers over it, and if the label is smooth, the food is fresh. If it has bumps, it has spoiled.?\"Expiration dates are set at the worst-case scenario, but the reality is that we keep our food much better than that. Dates are shortened to protect consumers in the rare case of problems in the supply chain or in our homes,\" said Mimica founder and director Solveiga Pak?tait?.During a pandemic where many people around the world are unable to make it to the store as frequently as before, but still need healthy, fresh produce, this new technology can extend food¡¦s shelf-life and help retailers¡¦ bottom lines.\"Add back just two days, and we can see food waste being cut in half in our stores, more than that in our homes, and sales go up when shelf life is extended,\" Pak?tait? added. \"With products like juice and beef, the shelf life doubles.\"Overall, a more circular food system is something that can help both companies and consumers.?\"Businesses are already paying millions of dollars a year to throw away perfectly good food,\" said Jasmine Crowe, CEO of Goodr, who spoke on the virtual stage at Circularity 20. \"Waste is not a new spend on anybody¡¦s line item. This is something that every business is paying for ¡X so how can we get businesses to think about what is going into landfills differently?\"',\n",
              " 'Even in an era of deep partisan division, planting trees and restoring forests to the United States¡¦ natural and working landscapes represents a shared priority of both U.S. political parties. Republican leaders repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the Trillion Trees Initiative, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that establishes an interagency council to coordinate federal restoration and conservation activities. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats included forest restoration and protection as key climate strategies in reports released by the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and the Senate Democrats¡¦ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis.Despite the bipartisan rhetoric on tree planting, few concrete actions have moved forward to grow and protect more trees in the United States. Many hope that the new administration of President-elect Joe Biden and an almost evenly split 117th Congress will be able to change that when they take office in January.On Nov. 9, a coalition known as the Forest-Climate Working Group with diverse interests across the forest sector ¡X including forestry businesses, conservation nonprofits, academic institutions, state foresters and private landowners ¡X released a policy platform that aims to increase the ability of U.S. forests to fight climate change. WRI¡¦s independent research has found that three policies included in the group¡¦s platform could play a particularly important role in restoring trees to U.S. landscapes.If enacted, these policies could help kickstart a robust national plan for carbon removal, and would put the United States on a path to grow up to 60 billion new trees in the next 20 years. A tree restoration campaign of that size could remove up to 540 million tons of CO2 per year by 2040 ¡X an amount equal to the entire annual emissions of U.S. agriculture ¡X while creating more than 150,000 jobs.Here are three of the most impactful steps that Biden and the new Congress can take to harness the carbon-removing power of trees and forests in the United States:Most forestlands in the United States are privately owned. Therefore, private lands offer the greatest potential for growing new trees. Private landowners must shoulder significant upfront costs ¡X ranging from 50 to over 500 per acre?¡X to plan and implement a tree restoration project. The federal government can ease that burden by giving landowners financial incentives to enhance carbon removal through tree restoration.One way to incentivize landowners would be through a transferable tax credit. The value of the tax credit could link to the amount of carbon removed by trees and forests on a property above baseline levels, similarly to how section 45Q of the Federal Tax Code awards credits for carbon removed by technologies such as direct air capture. The tax credit policy also should include provisions to account for lifecycle carbon impacts of tree restoration projects ¡X including emissions from forest clearing or timber harvest ¡X and avoid double-counting with forest projects registered in carbon markets.For landowners who do not have the money or resources to measure carbon removal, such as small or disadvantaged landowners, the tax credit value could link to an approved set of practices that remove additional carbon from the atmosphere, such as planting windbreaks around croplands or removing competing vegetation to promote forest regeneration. Smaller landowners without significant tax liability still could earn the full value of the incentive by selling or transferring the tax credit to another taxpayer with greater liability.Congress also could use direct payments to incentivize tree-planting and forest restoration on private lands. To achieve the full potential amount of carbon removal from trees and forests, Congress would need to appropriate an additional 4 billion to 4.5 billion per year for tree restoration activities through existing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as well as grant programs for local jurisdictions.Statutory changes that would make existing USDA programs more effective at accelerating carbon removal include:A well-designed transferable tax credit for tree restoration or a comparable investment in USDA direct payment programs could be a powerful tool to accelerate carbon removal in privately-owned forests.While growing trees on private lands may hold greater total potential for carbon removal, restoring forests on federal lands arguably presents one of the most urgent opportunities for climate action. In Western states, fires burned through millions of acres in 2020 alone, with two to six times more forest land predicted to burn annually by 2050. In recent years, pests such as mountain pine beetle also have killed trees across millions more acres of forest.Many of these areas need human intervention to restore and manage forests in ways that will make them more resilient to future fires and pests. An upcoming research paper from The Nature Conservancy estimates that 12 million acres of federal lands are in need of reforestation, including 7.7 million acres within national forests. The federal Reforestation Trust Fund, established by Congress in 1980, can distribute only 30 million per year due to a cap in the original legislation. This money only allows the U.S. Forest Service to support 100,000 acres of reforestation annually?¡X less than 2 percent of the needed reforestation.Removing this outdated funding cap from the Reforestation Trust Fund is a common-sense first step to help the Forest Service begin to catch up on their backlog of reforestation projects. The fund could provide over 100 million from existing tariffs on timber products to support increasing climate resilience and enhancing carbon removal on federal lands. The bipartisan REPLANT Act, which already has support from Trump, would do just that. If Congress doesn¡¦t pass this bill in 2020, it should be a top priority for Biden and congressional leaders of both parties in 2021.U.S. forests and forest products annually remove over 11 percent of U.S. carbon emissions from the atmosphere, based on data from the U.S. Forest Service¡¦s Forest Inventory & Analysis program (FIA). High-quality data are critical to advancing climate action in U.S. forests, as both the federal and state governments rely on FIA data to monitor forest health, plan forest management strategies and track forest growth and loss.While FIA is a globally leading source of forest carbon data, it is not designed to meet current demands for precise information on carbon emissions and removals at different scales and frequencies. For example, FIA data are not collected frequently enough to consistently identify the impact of wildfires on forest carbon. They also cannot support precise forest carbon estimates over a small geography, such as a county or protected area. Even at the national level, estimates of forest carbon are subject to more than twice as much uncertainty as emissions estimates for all energy use.Many options are available to strengthen forest carbon data, but the single most powerful measure would be to integrate remote sensing data into the U.S. forest inventory. Recent advances in mapping more accurately can show where trees are growing and storing carbon. Lidar ¡X which uses laser beams to record three-dimensional information such as tree height and forest structure ¡X can pair with FIA measurements to produce more precise carbon estimates at a higher resolution, and at a fraction of the cost of taking additional field sample measurements.Last year, NASA launched a new lidar collector on the International Space Station called the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). By establishing a carbon monitoring partnership between the U.S. Forest Service and NASA and investing in regular remote sensing data collection and integration, the federal government can improve forest carbon data products for policymaking and land management. An interagency authority on carbon monitoring also could leverage existing monitoring efforts from the private sector, academia and civil society ¡X including WRI.With a new grant from the Bezos Earth Fund, WRI and partners seek to develop a satellite-based system to monitor and measure carbon emissions and removals across the world¡¦s forests and other lands. Integrating innovative monitoring approaches such as WRI¡¦s with FIA¡¦s wealth of field data and NASA¡¦s cutting-edge research technologies could provide communities, governments, investors, non-government organizations and others with high-quality data to help them pursue strategies for natural solutions that address the climate crisis. These solutions in turn can support economic recovery, improve equity and enhance resilience.Growing trees and restoring forests to accelerate carbon removal represents one of the most promising avenues for bipartisan federal action on climate change in the months ahead. Businesses, environmental groups, universities and state governments agreed on a platform of common-sense policy solutions to grow more trees ¡X including creating a carbon removal tax credit, investing in reforestation on federal lands and strengthening the national forest inventory. These policies should feature in a broad plan to tackle the climate crisis under the Biden administration.A comprehensive policy plan also must confront the current and likely future sources of greenhouse gas emissions from forests and land use. Priorities for emissions reduction include protecting the massive carbon stores built up over centuries in old-growth forests such as the Tongass National Forest, rebuilding United States support to stop and reverse deforestation in the carbon-rich tropics, managing Western forests to be more resilient to future fires and reducing emissions from U.S. agriculture to ensure a food-secure future, while leaving more land available to grow trees. Accelerated carbon removal and ambitious emissions reductions from all sectors of the economy, including forests and land use, will be necessary to keep U.S. emissions on a trajectory aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.Biden and leaders in the House and Senate have a chance to lead on climate change by standing up for forests. To do so, they will need to turn their words of support into action.',\n",

In addition to the actions from the Treasury Department and enforcement of Dodd-Frank that will make dirty energy projects less attractive to investors, Biden could create more barriers to new dirty energy projects, such as restricting drilling on public lands.',\n",
              " 'Over the past decade, Colombia has set increasingly ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2020 alone, the government pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51 percent and install 4,000 megawatts of new, non-hydro, renewable electricity by 2030 ¡X about 24 percent of the country¡¦s projected electricity capacity.These goals aren¡¦t just promises ¡X in 2019, the government took its first steps toward achieving these targets by launching a renewable energy auction for 1,374 MW of new wind and solar power generation. While this action is an important start, the country will need to significantly ramp up its efforts over the coming years.Assuming the auction¡¦s resources come online by 2022, Colombia still must install an average of 280 MW each year for the subsequent nine years in order to reach the government¡¦s goal. This means adding about 55 percent more renewables capacity each year than the country had built in total prior to January 2020. In the Latin America region broadly, these aggressive investments in renewable energy could directly create 3.2 million jobs, nearly 8 percent of the projected total under a green energy transformation.Achieving this level of clean energy capacity will be challenging, but one major way Colombia can get there is by engaging the private sector ¡X and in particular, commercial and industrial (C&I) companies, which represent more than half of the country¡¦s electricity demand.Many large C&I energy buyers in the country?already have started to explore renewable energy solutions that shift their energy consumption to new sources that are both cleaner and less expensive. Market data from 2018 and 2019 shows that solar companies in Colombia can provide C&I customers with on-site renewable generation options at significantly lower rates than current grid prices, offering electricity cost savings up to 20 percent.While the potential benefits are significant, understanding how to navigate the process of switching to cost-saving renewable energy can be tricky. A new guidebook from the Clean Energy Investment Accelerator (CEIA), a partnership between Allotrope Partners, World Resources Institute and the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, outlines the options for C&I companies that want to procure renewable electricity in Colombia. Here are the three major ways they can do it:In Colombia, on-site turnkey purchases offer an option for the customer to buy a renewable energy system, such as a solar photovoltaic installation upfront and then be responsible for its associated operations and maintenance costs.On-site systems are typically installed on a customer¡¦s rooftop or grounds and connect directly to the buildings or facilities consuming the electricity. These systems require significant upfront costs; however, this option is the least expensive in the long run because once the financing is paid off, all electricity generation is free.For this reason, on-site turnkey purchases are a popular option in Colombia, with many leading corporations including Compa?ia Nacional de Chocolates, Ecopetrol and Tecnoglass investing in on-site solar generation. Collectively, these three companies already have installed over 25 million worth of solar electricity to deliver power directly to their facilities using on-site turnkey purchases.Another option involves using a power purchase agreement (PPA) or lease for an on-site renewable energy installation owned by a third party.Under a PPA, the vendor ¡X such as a developer or another service provider ¡X finances, operates and maintains the renewable energy system installed at the customer¡¦s site and sells the customer the generated electricity by the kilowatt-hour (kWh) over a set period of time (typically 10-20 years).In a lease agreement, the customer rents the renewable energy system ¡X typically for a flat rate each month, regardless how many kWh it produces ¡X and owns all the electricity it generates. This option provides savings immediately upon installation because it requires no cash investment upfront, making it an attractive option for some companies.Under an off-site third-party PPA, a generation company (\"genco\") owns and operates a large-scale renewable installation such as a solar or wind farm, which sits in a different location from the customer¡¦s facility. The genco is solely responsible for the system¡¦s financing and maintenance, and sells the customer electricity by the kWh, delivered across the public utility grid.In Colombia, a customer that chooses an off-site PPA must have a peak demand greater than 100 kilowatts, and can negotiate with its genco for a lower tariff rate. So far, off-site renewable energy PPAs have been rare in Colombia, in part due to restrictions and contracts that last 10-20 years. Such a term length is often considered too long when compared with conventional, non-renewable PPAs, which typically span three to five years.Hundreds of companies globally have established science-based targets to reduce their emissions or have committed to ambitious renewable energy goals. With increasingly attractive pathways to renewable energy available, companies in Colombia can save money, lower their carbon footprints, support the government¡¦s renewable energy targets and unlock a cleaner future.To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change and curb global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, C&I energy buyers across the globe must act quickly to take a leading role in decarbonizing the power sector by mid-century or sooner.For a more detailed view of the different procurement options available in Colombia, download the Clean Energy Investment Accelerator¡¦s \"Renewable Energy Procurement Guidebook for Colombia.\"',\n",
              " 'The concept of reaching net zero emissions has grown from an emerging idea to a mainstream mechanism for countries, cities and corporations to drive emissions reductions and limit the effects of climate change.Just two years ago, only a handful of companies committed to achieving net zero emissions by mid-century or sooner. Since then, a wave of companies across sectors have adopted net zero targets and are designing strategies to achieve these goals.Net zero commitments cover one-fifth of the world¡¦s largest corporations and 68 percent of global GDP, compared to 16 percent in 2019.It is critical that businesses set net-zero targets and for everyone to be confident about how they will be achieved. The lack of a standardized approach has meant companies have been devising their net-zero strategies with little transparency on the scope and boundary of the targets and the plans for reaching them.This has led to skepticism about these corporate targets and concerns that they are a new form of greenwashing. Critics have been especially concerned about corporate net zero targets depending heavily on carbon offsets, rather than a business taking rapid action to decarbonize its own value chain where accountability and influence are highest. Carbon offset projects often generate a greenhouse gas (GHG) credit, a unit of carbon dioxide that is reduced, avoided or sequestered. And companies typically use investments in offsets to enable claims of climate neutral, carbon neutral or climate positive ¡X such as building wind farms, planting trees and energy efficiency projects.Corporate net-zero targets can be a powerful tool for curbing emissions and addressing the climate crisis ¡X but only if proper safeguards are implemented. Here are three approaches companies should take to demonstrate that their net-zero targets are credible and will accelerate climate action:Companies can do this by committing to ambitious near-term action by setting 5 to 10-year science-based targets developed in line with the scale of reductions required to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Near-term science-based targets put companies on a trajectory to net-zero without reliance on offsets or other types of carbon credits. These targets provide companies with a clear route of how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions across their full value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and are most popularly validated through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a global body enabling businesses to take action on climate change, to ensure credibility.GHG Protocol categorizes companies¡¦ greenhouse gas emissions into three scopes ¡X Scope 1 covering direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; Scope 2 covering indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company; and Scope 3 including all other indirect emissions that occur across a company¡¦s value chain.Near-term actions companies can take to reduce emissions and meet their science-based targets include investing in technologies such as electric fleet vehicles; adopting sustainable business travel policies; and shift away from fossil fuel production and consumption towards renewable energy such as solar and wind, or by using sustainable biofuels. These actions can lead to significant reductions immediately, essential to achieving a net-zero world.Net-zero for corporations is defined by SBTi as reducing Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions to zero ¡X or to a residual level consistent with reaching net-zero emissions ¡X at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5C-aligned pathways, and then neutralizing any residual emissions at the net-zero target year and any GHG emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter.Research by the IEA climate experts suggests to achieve net-zero most companies can, and should, reduce their CO2 emissions by 90-95 percent by 2050 or sooner, leaving the remaining 5 percent-10 percent that are not possible to eliminate to be neutralized by carbon removals.Companies shouldn¡¦t claim to be net-zero until they have fully decarbonized or reached a state of residual emissions and balanced those unabated emissions with high-quality removals. Examples of removal options for companies that need to balance residual emissions include carbon credits from land restoration, improved forest management and direct air capture and storage.There is an urgent need to scale up near-term finance of nature-based solutions and nascent carbon removal technologies to increase the global community¡¦s likelihood of staying within a 1.5C carbon budget. Companies play an important role in providing the finance needed for these solutions.However, these investments can¡¦t replace or delay deep emissions cuts within a company¡¦s value chain if we want to reach global net-zero.Examples of beyond-the-value chain mitigation actions or investments in projects related (but not limited) to forestry, conservation, energy efficiency, methane destruction and early-stage carbon dioxide removal technologies.While there is already a large cadre of companies setting near-term science-based targets and a growing number of companies setting long-term targets, companies next need to take on the responsibility for financing additional mitigation activities outside their value chains. Investors, customers, employees and civil society actors need to create an expectation for companies to take responsibility and compensate for their historical emissions and unabated emissions along the path to net-zero by investing in beyond value chain mitigation.Ultimately, companies need to focus on getting their own house in order first by setting near and long-term science-based targets and moving toward net zero. Only when a company is on the path to reducing emissions in line with science along the value chain can investments in offsets be considered. Stakeholders are justified to be skeptical of net-zero targets that don¡¦t follow this framework.To enable credible net-zero targets, the Science Based Targets initiative has developed a standard for validating corporate net-zero targets, as previously mentioned. This standard provides clear criteria for ensuring corporate net-zero targets are robust and is the result of an extensive engagement process amongst the scientific community, companies and civil society. It defines near-term and long-term ambition to curb emissions and under what conditions it is appropriate to use offsets.Rapidly curbing carbon dioxide emissions this decade and reaching net-zero emission by mid-century are critical to addressing the threat of climate change ¡X and every country, sector and industry has an important role to play. We will need every tool in our toolbox to overcome the climate crisis, including credible and robust corporate net-zero targets.Footnote: Starting in July, the SBTi will only validate 1.5 degrees C targets.',\n",
              " 'To reach the United States¡¦ target of reducing net emissions by 50-52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, the federal government and non-federal actors will need to increase the ability of natural and working lands to sequester and store carbon. A recent economy-wide analysis finds that reaching these climate goals will require the United States to enable its lands and forests, or its land carbon sink, to remove at least 913 Mt CO2e annually by 2030, which represents a 13 percent increase in yearly sequestration over 2019 levels. This increase in sequestration would be equal to the emissions from over 20 million cars every year.To achieve this, the nation must restore trees to the landscape, increase the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and protect landscapes that already store carbon. Federal investment and action from all levels of society can allow the United States to achieve the full potential of these pathways, creating jobs and other economic benefits in the process.Congress has a historic opportunity to invest in these practices and demonstrate climate leadership in advance of COP26 through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and President Joe Biden¡¦s Build Back Better Agenda, which Congressional leaders are looking to implement through a budget reconciliation bill. As they are written, these bills would channel unprecedented levels of funding to incentivize climate-smart practices on private land, reduce wildfire risk, improve forest carbon inventories and build a climate workforce, moving the nation closer to realizing the potential of its land carbon sink.Ambitious and immediate federal investment in these areas could also create hundreds of thousands of jobs; offer local, state and federal tax revenue; and add value to economies in every state across the United States. The win-win combination of climate benefits and job creation would help advance the nation toward a sustainable new climate economy.These bills face ongoing negotiation, and there is concern that funding for lands and conservation could decrease in the face of pressure to limit spending across Biden¡¦s agenda. As these two bills move through the legislative process in the coming weeks, Congress needs to ensure that lands remain a priority and funding levels remain robust to reflect the urgent need for this investment and the economic benefits it will bring.While action is needed across all land sectors, research shows that three tree-based pathways hold the greatest opportunity for enhancing natural carbon removal in the near-term while supporting jobs and economic vitality. WRI analysis shows that these pathways could offer an attractive return on investment: they require a total federal investment of 126.6 billion over 20 years and would support about 3.9 million job-years (or 199,000 jobs each year for 20 years). Put another way, 31.4 jobs would be supported for every million dollars of federal investment. Over 20 years, this investment would also generate 226.8 billion in value added to local economies, including 164.4 billion in employee compensation and 12.2 billion in state, federal and local taxes.Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the House Build Back Better Act include 29.8 billion over nine years for agricultural conservation and forest management, which would represent an initial investment in realizing the land carbon sink and job creation potential.Here are three pathways for tree-based carbon removal, which should be a priority for federal funding in both bills:Trees are a carbon-removing technology that is ready for deployment today. Although building the infrastructure to plant healthy forests at the necessary scale will require considerable investment and work, professionals are already working to plant and manage trees and forests every day. Federal investment in reforestation and forest restocking could help to expand employment in these sectors, particularly in rural areas, where 67 percent of job creation potential exists.Across federal, state, local and private lands, there is an opportunity to reforest historically forested land that has been cleared, disrupted or burned and has lost the ability to sequester carbon. There is also an opportunity to restock, or increase the density of, existing forests in the eastern and midwestern United States where trees have been lost due to disease or disruption, and where increased forested density would not increase fire risk.Non-federal lands, which include state, local and private lands, hold the greatest potential for carbon removal and job creation. In these lands, 185.4 million acres are eligible for reforestation and restocking. This could remove 156 MtCO2e per year by 2030, and up to 312 MtCO2e per year in 2040 and beyond. Reforestation and restocking on non-federal land could also support 68,100 jobs across multiple sectors annually.Federal lands offer an additional 18 million acres suitable for reforestation and restocking. Collectively, these lands could sequester an additional 17 MtCO2e per year by 2030 and up to 35 MtCO2e per year in 2040 and beyond. Investment in reforestation and restocking on federal land could support 11,700 jobs annually.Across both federal and non-federal lands, an annual federal investment of 3 billion per year for 20 years could support 79,800 jobs annually, or 26.8 jobs per 1 million dollars of investment. Missouri, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would see the highest total levels of job creation from reforestation and restocking across all land ownership types.Agroforestry, or the practice of incorporating trees into agricultural systems, could help expand trees and their climate benefits. This would also benefit farmers and ranchers, as agroforestry can improve soil, crop and animal health, and provide added revenue from forest products and timber. Agroforestry practices with notable climate benefits include silvopasture, or integrating trees into animal agriculture; alley cropping, or interspersing row crops with rows of trees; and planting windbreaks, or strategically placed groups of shrubs and trees that prevent soil erosion and protect crops and livestock. There are about 110.9 million acres of U.S. cropland and pastureland that may be eligible for agroforestry and could sequester 156 MMT CO2e per year.Establishing and maintaining agroforestry systems can be labor-intensive and require specialized expertise, which can further support jobs. However, agroforestry systems can be expensive to establish, which can pose a barrier for farmers. Federal investment can help landowners establish agroforestry systems and support jobs in the process. An annual federal investment of 1.8 billion in agroforestry could support 49,500 jobs annually, or 27.4 jobs per million dollars invested, and provide other economic benefits. Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Texas would see the highest total levels of job creation from expansion of agroforestry.Many forests in the United States, particularly in Western states, are at high risk for severe fire due to widespread tree death from drought, disease and historical fire suppression. Severe fires threaten forest-adjacent communities and permanently damage trees and ecosystems, which can turn forests into a source of emissions. Wildfires also produce pollutants that can increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular health problems in people who inhale smoke.Techniques to reduce severe wildfire risk include removing biomass, strategically thinning out overly dense forests and conducting controlled, low-intensity burns to remove fuels that could feed severe blazes. These kinds of treatments ¡X known as fuel load treatments ¡X do not prevent wildfire from occurring, but they lower the risk of massive fires. Prescribed burning alone could reduce wildfire carbon emissions in the western United States by 18¡V25 percent and could increase long-term forest carbon storage by 18 MtCO2 per year through avoided tree mortality.The increasing frequency of catastrophic wildfires across the United States highlights the importance of ambitious and immediate investment to increase ecosystem health and reduce the risk of severe wildfire. There are over 86.7 million acres of forest in the nation that could be eligible for fuel load treatments. Federal investment could help mitigate the risk of wildfire in these forests and would directly employ prescribed burn professionals and forestry professionals. Fuel load treatment also generates biomass and timber that can have downstream uses that generate employment.Accounting for both fuel load treatment jobs and jobs supporting wood and biomass processing, a yearly federal investment of 1.5 billion in fuel load reduction could support 69,600 jobs, or 45.2 jobs per million dollars invested. The states with most potential to support jobs related to wildfire risk mitigation are California, New Mexico, Wyoming, Oregon and Idaho.While federal action is essential to enhance and protect the land carbon sink, reaching the nation¡¦s climate goals will require states, local governments, the private sector and civil society to push forward their own initiatives to reforest and restock forests and to mitigate wildfire risk. For example:Through the proposals in front of Congress, there is an opportunity to allocate funding to these pathways, which would create jobs and add value to economies across the country while removing carbon from the air. Federal investments would also help to catalyze and support action at all levels of society and move the United States closer to reaching its 2030 climate goals. Investments in natural carbon removal also need to be accompanied by job training programs and policy guardrails ¡X as they are in many parts of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Act ¡X to create high-quality, accessible jobs. Passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Build Back Better Act with current levels of funding is a critical step toward building a new climate economy that creates a just, low-carbon future.Note: Where not otherwise specified, economic impact, acreage potential and carbon removal potential were derived as part of analysis for WRI¡¦s working paper The Economic Benefits of The New Climate Economy in Rural America.',\n",
              " 'To achieve New York¡¦s ambitious climate and clean energy goals outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), New York needs to aggressively reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transportation sector ¡X the largest source of emissions in the state. ?Thus far, most of the transportation emission reductions have been focused on passenger vehicles. But in order to achieve widespread pollution reductions in the transportation sector, the Empire State also needs to consider how to electrify trucks and buses to clean up the air we breathe and provide clean transportation options for all.New York already has taken important initial steps to electrify trucks and buses, most recently by signing onto a 15-state Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which sets a goal for 100 percent of truck and bus sales to be electric by 2050 and for 30 percent to be electric by 2030.However, to achieve the state\\'s climate and zero-emission vehicle goals, more needs to be done. The price tag to electrify buses and trucks, as well as provide charging infrastructure to support these vehicles, is high but nevertheless important.Luckily, policy pathways can help reduce these costs and barriers and support the expansion of electric trucks and buses in New York.To meet its 2030 goal, New York will need to support about 38,366 electrified trucks and buses. As the average upfront price of an electric truck or bus is much higher than its diesel counterparts, as shown in Table 1, the cost of electric truck and bus purchases needed to electrify over 38,000 trucks and buses is about 2,023,383,620.It should be noted that the total cost of ownership of electric trucks and buses is lower than diesel because of operational savings.Thankfully, New York state will not need to front this whole bill ¡X operational savings such as lower fueling and maintenance costs can help offset the higher upfront costs of electric trucks and buses.However, the costs of the vehicles aren¡¦t the only financial barrier the state needs to consider ¡X infrastructure needs to be?available to charge these vehicles.Needed charging infrastructure is harder to estimate than vehicle needs because of the nascent state of the market and the variance of needs between vehicle and fleet type. For this analysis, I calculated the public charging needs and assumed medium-duty trucks use Level 2 charging and bigger heavy-duty trucks use Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) ¡X not including depot charging or \"home bases\" which would require further analysis. Due to the variance of needs, the cost estimations of this analysis may be low in comparison to the actual uptake price.Based on these assumptions, to support the number of electric trucks and buses the state needs by 2030, New York needs about 98 additional high-powered DCFC public stations and 695 Level 2 public stations for an estimate cost of about 17,545,007.In addition to the charging station costs, the state also will need to consider make-ready costs, such as electrical infrastructure (transformers and wiring) required to prepare charging sites. Based on estimated station needs for both Level 2 and DCFC stations, estimated make-ready costs are about 23,929,517 ¡X calculated from the average price of Level 2 and DCFC make-ready needs per site, the number of chargers needed from each type as well as the number of sites needed across New York.Given this data on charging costs, vehicle costs and make-ready costs, the total estimated cost of truck and bus electrification by 2030 is about 2,064,857,144, as shown in Table 2.While this number is large, implementing programs and policies to support the electrification of trucks and buses can help alleviate this financial barrier.New York has started taking the needed steps to support truck and bus electrification, but to tackle the scope of the problem more needs to be done. Additional policy pathways for truck and bus electrification in New York can be modeled based on policies from other states.For example, in June, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the Advanced Clean Truck Rule (ACT), a policy that requires truck and bus manufacturers to sell electric trucks as an increasing percentage of sales. The adoption of California policies such as the ACT in New York would be a promising step toward reaching 100 percent electric truck and bus sales by 2050.No single perfect policy or program can tackle the full scale of the issue. To support truck and bus electrification, multiple policy and financial pathways need to be used. To support the Empire State¡¦s goals for electrification, we need incentive programs to fund the uptake this task will require.Incentives are an important strategy to help close the gap between electric and diesel vehicle upfront costs. New York can support and fund incentives through programs such as a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the Transportation Climate Initiative market-based policy and expanding programs already in place, such as the Clean Truck Voucher Program.For charging stations, utilities can help support the expansion of a statewide network. For example, New York¡¦s Make-Ready Program is funded by investor-owned utilities and provides essential charging infrastructure to support statewide electrification. Through this program, New York is committing 15 million in make-ready funds for trucks and buses.To fully achieve New York¡¦s goals, we will need a comprehensive and strategic plan that uses current initiatives?as well as new, promising policy pathways. The task of electrifying New York¡¦s trucks and buses is a big one, but by implementing some of the strategies here, not insurmountable.This blog was authored by NRDC Summer Schneider Clean Energy Intern Chloe Gould, a student at Stanford University.',\n",

Among other things, Allbirds uses an internal carbon price for every pair of shoes produced, as a means of better accounting for its impact.\"It¡¦s helped to attract those employees who really want to have an impact and work for a company that really stood for something,\" Kajimura said. \"We don¡¦t just have product developers working for us, we have product developers who care about sustainability and who are always asking, ¡¥What can I do differently? What can I do better?¡¦\"Balancing quick-win investments, such as an LED lighting retrofit, with a deeper commitment to managing physical or regulatory risks related to climate change is also important, said Emily Williams, vice president of strategy and sustainability for service provider Edison Energy.?\"I think some of the longer-term risk integration is something that a lot of organizations are struggling with, and really just kind of getting started on with the transition to net zero,\" she said.?While Walmart is a much larger company than Allbirds, it shares the philosophy that employee mindsets are central to taking practical and meaningful steps toward net zero. That means not just marketing these ideas, but consulting them as stakeholders for input on taking action.?Jane Ewing, senior vice president of sustainability for the massive retailer, said that when Walmart was in the process of setting its latest commitment targeting zero emissions in its operations by 2040, it consulted leaders of groups across the organization. It actively engages workers at every level to share details of progress, which it typically announces each year at a milestone event.\"We made sure our associates across the stores and the clubs and the different countries had access to those materials, videos?and Q&As, and we just continued to beat that drum,\" she said.???That need for engagement also applies to supply chain partners, something that Walmart has embraced through its Project Gigaton initiative, which includes about 2,300 of its suppliers that have set climate goals related to energy, packaging, waste, agriculture, forests and product use. \"It¡¦s this portfolio view of changing the mindset at the top of the organization or with the procurement organization that it shouldn¡¦t be about just chasing the lowest cost but how are you incorporating sustainability decisions into your procurement decisions,\" noted Edison¡¦s Williams. \"This is really the way to have that multiplier effect that we need.\"Just Salad¡¦s decision to publish a carbon footprint label for its menu items, is helping consumers make informed decisions about their ordering (a move mimicked by Panera Bread), and has become a central component of its decisions about what new ingredients to include in its offerings, according to Noonan. In a sense, that makes it simpler to choose.?\"Because we¡¦ve already calculated the average emissions of our menu, we really don¡¦t want to go outside that range;?we want to hold ourselves to a lower carbon footprint threshold than our highest items,\" she said. \"And that means we¡¦re developing salads that are balanced, and their combination of daily or protein is kept within a range. It also helps us with suppliers.\"?The focus on net zero is also translating into a shift in product development and research priorities for several?companies represented in the sessions. \"I think it¡¦s kind of the first strategy of native net zero to embed carbon into the decisions you make about your products, and I think the second strategy is enabling your customers to take action,\" said Watershed¡¦s Francis.One exemplar is Shopify, a Canadian software company that helps small merchants add e-commerce capabilities to their websites. Not only is Shopify taking steps to nurture emerging technologies and approaches for carbon removal with a 5 million investment fund, it¡¦s also prioritizing new services for its customers that take the need to accelerate carbon removal in mind. One example is its Offset app, which helps small businesses balance their impact from transportation emissions related to their orders, by investing in projects that Shopify has identified.\"It¡¦s easy and affordable to them because we¡¦re able to aggregate all these small businesses together,\" said Stacy Kauk, director of the sustainability fund for Shopify. \"That¡¦s one way we can actually dig into our supply chain, right? If we think about that opportunity to influence our major suppliers and carriers, we have that access point. And then our merchants are able to benefit from that aggregation that takes place on our platform.\"Another example is the sugarcane-derived shoe sole that Allbirds developed to replace materials derived from petroleum. As Kajimura related, the company partnered with a new supplier to develop the approach ¡X?it chose to address sole foam because it could have a broad impact. Then, it decided to \"open source\" the information so that other shoe companies could consider the material.\"Not only did this result in the single biggest reduction in our carbon footprint so far, because it was one material that scaled across all our products, but it also has led to companies from Ugg to Reebok to Timberland using that material now in their shoes on a larger scale,\" Kajimura said. \"So that¡¦s a business model we¡¦re trying to repeat again and again.\"',\n",
              " 'Let¡¦s begin the week with an injection of inspiration and hope. But also a nudge, or maybe a shove.Today,?we introduce the 2021 cohort of the \"GreenBiz 30 Under 30,\" two-and-a-half dozen extraordinary women and men in sustainability worth watching. It¡¦s a moment when we get to turn away from the often mind-numbing drumbeat of news about the world and its many problems and look instead at some rising talent who will help us find our way through them.The Class of 2021, our sixth annual ¡X 18 women and 12 men from 12 nations ¡X represents the best of what most of us aspire to be: committed; creative; collaborative; courageous. I encourage you to peruse each of their brief stories and follow or connect with them on social media. (High praise to the GreenBiz editorial team, particularly to Elsa Wenzel, who edited this project, for the unenviable task of choosing from among the hundreds of awesome candidates, then capturing their essence in under 250 words.)Since our first cohort in 2016, the annual \"30 Under 30\" selection process has become both easier and harder. Easier because?so many more inspired and inspiring young people are choosing sustainability as their professional path, each bringing their unique talents, insights and life experiences. Which also makes it harder, winnowing the candidates to just 30 individuals.But all of this?is just a start.Our responsibility as sustainability professionals ¡X each of us, you and I included ¡X doesn¡¦t end with publishing and celebrating this annual list. These 30 individuals deserve support and encouragement, benefitting from our successes, missteps, historical perspective and institutional knowledge. Without that, they will no doubt find their way, as most of us have, but they will lose precious time at a moment when time may be our greatest limited resource.Many of you represent the pioneers in sustainable business, literally inventing the profession that others are just?entering, and you have a lot to offer, probably more than you realize. A lot to learn, too, as I expect you¡¦ll glean plenty of insights and inspiration from engaging with these young leaders. Whatever they may lack in life and professional experience, they more than make up for with an appetite for learning, a lust for impact and a facility with the tools and resources that have become the birthright of today¡¦s digital natives.Of course, all of that also goes for the thousands of other \"under 30s\" who didn¡¦t happen to make our list. No doubt,?some worthy souls within your organization, community or professional network could benefit from your tutelage.Beyond that is a bigger challenge: Knowing when and how to make room for the next generation to flourish. I¡¦m not talking about early retirement, job-sharing or anything of the sort. I¡¦m talking about empowering young professionals to step into leadership roles, perhaps faster than you did, perhaps faster than you may deem appropriate.Easy to say, hard to do. Giving up or sharing one¡¦s turf after all the years (or decades) it took to get there doesn¡¦t come naturally for most people, especially for those of us who are passionate about what we do and still have plenty of energy to keep doing it. And it¡¦s not necessarily about \"giving up\" anything. It¡¦s about creating a space for others, then doing whatever you can to help them succeed. Along the way, you will, too.I have some experience with this. At age 69 and after more than three decades in the field of sustainable business and clean technology, I have no plans to sail off into the sunset (though there are days when the sunset beckons). But I¡¦m learning, slowly but surely, how and when to take a step back, letting other, younger players step in. It means transitioning from being the \"sage on the stage\" to becoming a \"guide on the side,\" not always a seamless makeover?for an extrovert who enjoys the limelight.Of course, these two roles ¡X sage and guide ¡X aren¡¦t mutually exclusive. There remain plenty of opportunities to be in the front of the room, and I relish those. But sustainability, more than most other careers, has a higher calling ¡X the greater good, the future well-being of our companies, our communities and our world. To simply do my thing, however rewarding and fulfilling, and not encourage and empower others still finding their way feels like a dereliction of duty.By the way, one doesn¡¦t need to be looking at the back end of their career to participate. I know plenty of professionals in their 50s, 40s, even 30s who actively coach or mentor their younger colleagues. Sometimes, it¡¦s simply a nonjudgmental ear to whom one can ask \"dumb\" questions. Of course, many of those questions are the same ones?we once asked.Entrepreneur Chip Conley, who popularized the notion of?\"modern elders,\"?points out that where knowledge is additive, wisdom is, fundamentally, a subtractive virtue. Wise people filter insights when others get lost inside mountains of knowledge, he notes. For those of us who have acquired some quantity of knowledge over time, it can be revelatory to boil things down to their essence and share that wisdom with those eager to gain from it.?So, how will you support this new generation of sustainability professionals? How will you show up for the leaders of tomorrow? What actions will you take to shorten their learning curve and accelerate their rise into positions of influence and authority? How can they more effectively follow in your footsteps ¡X or chart their own path?It¡¦s easy to slough all this off. You¡¦ve got a lot on your plate. You¡¦re overworked and under-resourced. You generally like the status quo. You¡¦re not ready to let others push you aside. Besides, the young ¡¦uns aren¡¦t yet truly ready to take the reins.All good. Supporting young leaders needn¡¦t be a huge time sink. It shouldn¡¦t require you to give anything up. You don¡¦t have to step back or step aside until you¡¦re good and ready.But we¡¦re in a different time that requires a different mindset, a new way of thinking about the role of a sustainability professional beyond one¡¦s formal job description. It¡¦s about broadening the tent, growing the field, accelerating our collective impact.It can be endlessly gratifying and immeasurably valuable.Indeed, there may be no more important or fulfilling work that many of us will?do.I invite you to?follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Monday morning newsletter,?GreenBuzz, and listen to?GreenBiz 350, my weekly podcast, co-hosted with Heather Clancy.',\n",
              " 'The No. 1 question I get asked by job seekers, hands down, is \"What certification should I get if I want to work in sustainability?\" And I know everyone hates it when I have to respond with \"It depends,\" but it really, truly does.The 2020 GreenBiz State of the Profession Report included a fantastic chart titled \"Percentage of survey respondents having received training or certification,\" which showed the following breakdown:So, if you were?to pick a certification out of a hat, it might be a pretty safe bet to?get GRI or maybe some form of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design series. But perhaps you noticed that the No. 2 most popular certification was \"Other\" or that GRI was the only named certification to get more than 25 percent? That should tell you that there are no easy answers here and that there is no one-size-fits-all certification for sustainability professionals.?A better approach would be to do some critical thinking about any gaps between your existing skillset and the skills required to do the work you are hoping to do next. Take a close look at the job descriptions that excite you. What subject matter expertise or certifications do the job descriptions call for? Talk to people?already doing the type of work you want to do. What training do they have? What frameworks and tools do they use? That should help you identify what certifications might make you a more competitive candidate.?Also remember that professional certifications are not the only way to gain credibility. They should be only one part of your larger plan for gaining experience, which could include other avenues such as taking on new projects at your current job, fellowships, school and skills-based volunteering.?Okay, so now that you¡¦ve done your research and you know what kind of skills you need to build, and you¡¦ve decided that training for a certification is the right way to build them, what options are out there??The below list includes nearly 30 certifications that will help you understand the landscape of professional certifications in sustainability. The focus of this list is on professional certifications for practitioners only or, put another way, certifications that demonstrate that you as a person have a specific skill or knowledge set.?The list does not include certifications for products (such as Forest Stewardship Council for wood products) or companies (such as B Corp for values-led companies), professional training that does not earn a credential (I have some great suggestions for that in this article and in the Training section of this page), graduate programs or university-based certificates.?I¡¦m 100 percent confident that I\\'ve missed an incredible certification program. If so, please let me know about it by reaching out via my website.

Both organizations offer programs for young professionals or those new to sustainability.?The world of corporate sustainability reporting is not for the faint of heart. The organizations that comprise the infamous alphabet soup of reporting frameworks and standards each provide their own approach to the reporting of sustainable value creation and disclosure of climate-related risks, which makes deciding what reporting-related certification to pursue incredibly difficult.To make things even more complicated, the landscape is changing at a rapid pace. In September, five of the leading reporting groups (CDP, CDSB, GRI, IIRC and SASB) issued a statement of intent to work together to create a comprehensive global corporate reporting system and a mere two months later, IIRC and SASB announced an intent to merge to become the Value Reporting Foundation.?According to this GreenBiz article on the state of corporate reporting, we¡¦re not likely to have one single framework that everyone uses anytime soon (if ever). In addition, the only reporting framework that you¡¦ll ultimately absolutely need to know is the one that your future employer uses, and you won¡¦t know which one that will be until you¡¦re working there.?My advice to people who want to pursue a reporting certification is to do your own research on each leading framework and standard to see if any resonate with you. Ask practitioners in the industry that you¡¦d like to work in what frameworks they use. If you later find out that you need to know a specific framework for a particular role, you can learn it on the job or through a training program at that time.?Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) does not offer a formal certification program but TCFD e-learning courses are available on the TCFD Knowledge Hub.There are so many green building certification standards around the world that I couldn¡¦t possibly list them all here, so only four leading standards are below. Each has its own nuanced definition of what makes a building sustainable and approach for how building certification is achieved. Professional certification in one of these means that you¡¦ve demonstrated an understanding of sustainability and green building principles in general as well as the certification framework of the particular program.?Green building certifications are of most value to people whose work will focus on building design, construction or retrofitting such as designers and architects. That said, the built environment is a huge component of environmental impact for many organizations, so those hoping to work in sustainability strategy or program management may find this training beneficial as well.?LEED is the most well-known and prolific green building certification system in the United States. Buildings that are LEED certified have been designed and built using strategies aimed at improving performance in energy efficiency, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reductions, improved indoor air quality and stewardship of resources.?Green Globes is a science-based building rating system that supports a wide range of new construction and existing building project types. Green Globes buildings are energy-efficient, healthy and environmentally sustainable.?The Living Building Challenge has been described as the world¡¦s most rigorous green building and sustainable design certification standard. Living Buildings strive for net-zero or net-positive energy and are free of toxic chemicals.?The WELL Building Standard is a roadmap for creating and certifying spaces that advance human health and well-being across 10 core concepts. WELL works at any scale, from a single interior space to an entire organization.Green building principles are a great way to reduce a building¡¦s impact when remodeling or undergoing new construction, but there are also huge opportunities in improving the energy efficiency and management of existing buildings and connecting them to renewable energy sources.?These certifications are of most value to people whose work will focus on energy in buildings and/or renewable energy procurement.

              " 'As Congress?scrambles?to develop a bill to invest trillions of dollars in economic recovery, it seeks to create jobs, slash climate-warming emissions and help people struggling to pay their bills. Transformative energy efficiency investments would deliver major progress on all three.In a new?analysis, we look at almost 350 billion of investments to save energy in every sector of the economy, largely proposals currently before Congress as it develops a \"reconciliation\" bill. We find that these investments could achieve over the lifetime of the investments and savings:The new analysis does not include savings from expanding utility efficiency programs. However, in a recent fact sheet we present an analysis that found that spurring utilities through a combination of payments and fees to expand assistance for households and businesses to undertake energy-saving measures could cut 2.4 billion tons of emissions, with a federal cost of just 4 billion to 10 billion.350 billion is a big investment, far more than what the government spends on efficiency, but over 10 years, it¡¦s less than private spending on efficiency (and less than what supporters are seeking in the bill for renewable energy). We also found that a smaller 126 billion package could achieve more than half the impacts.How do we reap these benefits? These results combine our analyses of 21 potential investments across eight areas, as shown in the figure below.?These analyses are revised (some significantly) from a fact sheet we published in June, as proposals have been refined and new ideas brought forward.Here are a few key possibilities pending before Congress; a couple other items are in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that also is pending.Industrial decarbonization:?The greatest carbon savings per federal dollar, by far, would be for measures to reduce emissions and reduce costs in manufacturing plants, yet these proposals have received relatively little attention to date. For example, the First Three proposal would provide federal cost-sharing for the first three full-scale applications of new transformative industrial technologies that promise massive reductions in emissions, such as direct reduction of iron with \"green\" hydrogen. These incentives would be especially effective in pushing a transition to a clean industrial sector, with estimated savings of 1 billion tons of CO2. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Florida) recently introduced a bill to authorize such a program.Home retrofits and electrification:?A second key area is energy efficiency retrofits of homes ¡X especially for low- and moderate-income households that rent apartments and that live in single-family houses ¡X and installation of efficient heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. Although these measures have relatively modest carbon and energy savings per dollar invested, their equity and affordability benefits are large. They are essential to improve health and reduce costs for many people who are struggling to pay bills or living in poor conditions. And they are essential to help spur the market toward retrofits needed to reduce emissions from the more than 100 million existing homes that will still be around in 2050.An example is the GREAHT proposal to fund efficiency and heat pump upgrades, as well as solar panels, health and safety improvements, and resilience measures in buildings with nearly 9 million subsidized and naturally occurring affordable apartment units. GREAHT would cut 200 tons of CO2 emissions while providing 24 billion in energy savings and more in other benefits.Electric trucks and buses:?Our recent post makes clear that we need new investments in our transportation system that serve both travelers and the climate. One key step is a tax credit for the purchase of new electric trucks and other commercial vehicles, which are far behind electric cars in development and availability. A 30 percent tax credit, as proposed in the Senate Finance Committee¡¦s Clean Energy for America Act and Rep. Don Beyer¡¦s (D-Virginia) Green VAN Act, would help shift the freight sector to non-polluting vehicles. It could result in half a million more electric trucks and save 12 billion gallons of diesel fuel.Utility efficiency programs:?A key Biden administration goal for the reconciliation bill is to use a combination of tax credits, payments and fees to push the electric sector to 80 percent clean sources by 2030. To make that transition reliable, cost-effective and equitable, we believe reducing and managing demand are as important as developing new sources. To that end, in addition to the investments described in this white paper, we¡¦ve called for the bill to include provisions to spur utilities to meet a growing portion of energy needs through efficiency programs that help their customers save energy and costs. Boosting utilities¡¦ efficiency work will make it easier to meet remaining energy needs with clean power, help incorporate more electric equipment and more variable renewable power, and reduce costs for electric customers.With these energy efficiency investments, we can take a big step forward on the way to an economy that benefits all consumers, workers, and our climate.',\n",
              " 'It is highly probable your children will be vegans eating a Christmas ham Dec. 25, 2050. Alternative proteins will be the norm very soon and we might look back at this decade as the time when real shift in diets occurred.?Don¡¦t believe me? Here are a few stats. Venture capital invested 1.5 billion in alternative proteins in 2020. The plant-based meat market is predicted to grow from 3.6 billion in 2020 to 4.2 billion by 2021. And by 2040, 60 percent of meat sales will be plant-based or cultured meat products.?Every movement has the trends that significantly shape its future and others that quickly die and are forgotten. Here are four trends for 2021 that are expected to last beyond the initial excitement.?Fermentation, using genetically engineered microbes to mass-produce plant-based proteins, is on the verge of dramatically altering our protein food system. The value of fermentation lies in the system\\'s simplicity, effectiveness and flexibility to be used across food categories. Perfect Day uses fermentation to make dairy-like products while startups such as Clara Foods are focusing on egg substitutes. And there is about to be even more competition. According to a Prepared Foods report, 44 new fermentation companies launched in late 2019 and early 2020, a 91 percent increase compared to 2018.?But it looks like there will be plenty of money to go around. Even as COVID-19 upended global markets, alternative protein companies focusing on fermentation raised 435 million in venture capital by July, 58 percent more than in 2019. High-profile investors such as Al Gore and Bill Gates got in on the 2020 action, leading an 80 million investing round for Nature¡¦s Fynd in March. And in December, Nature¡¦s Fynd added 45 million from Oxford Finance and Trinity Capital. The company uses microbes found in Yellowstone National Park¡¦s famous geysers to grow a protein with all nine amino acids. As we move to 2021 and beyond, fermentation technology?likely will become a pillar of the alternative protein supply chain.?In early 2020, some premier alternative protein companies had restaurant-only strategies. Impossible Foods had chefs such as David Chang serving the burger at its trendy restaurants. Soon after, the focus expanded into fast-food chains. But when the pandemic shut down restaurants, it expedited a shift to grocery stores and even direct-to-consumer purchasing.?You can buy Impossible¡¦s ground \"beef\" at 15,000 Safeways, Krogers, Trader Joe¡¦s and many other grocery stores across the country. Beyond Meat, which was in grocery stores before Impossible, can be shipped directly to your door. Impossible Foods also created a shop section on its website, bypassing the grocery store middlemen completely.?Eclipse, a vegan ice cream company based in the Bay Area, shifted from partnerships with popular ice cream shops such as Salt & Straw to chef collaborations on limited-edition pints ice cream lovers can buy directly from Eclipse online. Next year, alternative protein companies will continue to take the pandemic\\'s lessons to heart by giving consumers the convenience of direct purchasing while the companies get to rake in dollars without the help of restaurants or grocers.While the alternative protein industry has made huge strides in the areas of ground beef and processed products such as chicken nuggets or fish sticks, a huge section of the meat market that has yet to be successfully tapped into is whole cuts. In fact, according to a USDA agricultural marketing and economic report, about 80 percent of meat purchases are whole cuts such as chicken breasts, steaks and loins. In 2021, the alternative protein industry will need to focus on innovating in this very valuable part of the market. Some are already doing it and planning on coming to market with consumer products next year. Atlast and Meati use precise mushroom cultivation to produce whole cut substitutes that taste and act like the real heterogenous meat versions.?\"The way we make bacon is the equivalent of making mushroom pork belly,\" said Eben Bayer, CEO of Atlast. \"We grow this blob of mushroom like a big piece of meat, and we run it right through a conventional pork slicer.\"To create bacon that has different layers and doesn¡¦t act like a standard mushroom, Atlast tightly controls and changes environmental factors such as airflow and temperature during the growing process to create mushroom sections that taste fattier and other sections that get crispy to create that true bacon experience. While the industry inches towards whole cuts in 2021, the companies that figure out how to make convincing plant versions of steaks, chicken breasts and hams at scale will have cracked the alternative protein market wide open.Many standard ingredients for alternative proteins are soy, oats, legumes and nuts. These are also some common allergens. One percent of the U.S. population is allergic to nuts. And estimates suggest up to 6 percent of the population has a gluten sensitivity, along with the many who have jumped on the trend of cutting out gluten without any intolerance. Legume allergies, such as peanuts and soy, are also frequent. In 2021, the industry will need to start creating products that cater to this demographic. Going vegan or vegetarian for people with allergens can be extremely difficult and limiting. Soy and gluten-free vegan options such as Sophie¡¦s Kitchen seafood products or Atlantic Natural Foods¡¦ Neat Meat will be important in making alternative proteins accessible to everyone.',\n",
              " 'As fires ravaged parts of the U.S., Turkey and Greece, and as historic floods swept through Belgium and Germany, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?released a harrowing warning: even if nations sharply cut emissions today, the global temperature is still likely to rise around 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next two decades. This dire report came on the heels of?an announcement by the International Energy Association (IEA)?that the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing up global carbon emissions to 1.5 billion tons this year.The evidence and warnings are forcing companies to focus on the critical role they play in the race to decarbonize and the urgent need to intensify their efforts. Most executives acknowledge that it is essential not only to put decarbonization at the top of the corporate agenda, but also to deliver on bolder commitments. Many have already expanded their emphasis from lowering Scope 1 and 2 emissions (those they generate themselves) to include Scope 3 (the harder-to-control emissions from their supply chain and consumers of their goods).Generally, companies leading the carbon transition follow two guiding principles:1. They simultaneously play defense and offense.2. They view decarbonization as a way to accelerate a full-potential transformation.Many companies begin their decarbonization efforts as a way of defending themselves, often by preparing for reporting requirements or anticipating shareholder expectations. They also consider how they will mitigate potential physical risks. Mining and agriculture companies, for instance, need to anticipate how water scarcity, flooding and rising temperatures linked to climate change will hurt productivity. Playing defense also means preparing for the issue of stranded assets.Carbon transition, however, represents as much upside opportunity as downside risk. Companies are playing offense by taking proactive steps to create new value. Take Bosch, for example. Beyond achieving carbon neutrality, the company is developing new products and services to help other companies decarbonize, too.Embracing the need for a full strategy overhaul is the second guiding principle. Last year, in a Bain & Company survey of 80 business leaders in oil and gas, utilities, new energy, chemicals, agribusiness, mining and minerals services, and financial markets, 60 percent said an energy or resource transition was central to the future of their sector, and 35 percent are starting to change their priorities to create opportunities. Those leaders acknowledge the climate imperative requires a full-potential transformation that touches every part of the organization.Companies pursue three types of transformations. Some, such as Unilever, have evolved their core business?toward sustainability. Others have added a second core. Finland¡¦s Neste?has become the world¡¦s biggest producer of renewable diesel, alongside its traditional oil business, dropping the word \"oil\" from its name in the process. Others have changed their core entirely. Denmark¡¦s ?rsted used the carbon challenge as an opportunity?to develop a market for offshore wind.As they pursue their carbon transition, companies must answer four big questions:1. Is there sustained, visible leadership commitment combined with aligned incentives?Even the best corporate intentions won¡¦t succeed without commitment and direction from the CEO. Top leadership needs to back external commitments with action, integrating decarbonization into ongoing organizational dialogue. The company needs to ensure incentives are aligned to decarbonization results and cascade broadly throughout the organization. Such incentives connected to carbon objectives were key to Bosch¡¦s ability to deliver carbon-neutral operations in 2020.2. Is there a bankable plan owned by line management, with ruthless prioritization across sites?Companies that achieve the best results translate their decarbonization ambition into operational plan targets that are owned by line management, prioritizing initiatives that optimize value throughout the decarbonization journey and result in EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) uplift. For example, chemical holding company Indorama set aggressive site-by-site EBITDA targets that kept it on track for accelerating emissions reduction.3. Is the organization set up to win, learn and scale in a systematic way?Companies need to ensure the right operating model, people and technologies are in place to quickly scale decarbonization efforts while strengthening the collective experience curve. Norway-based energy company Equinor, for example, reorganized in a way that will help the company better pursue renewable fuel alternatives and reduce emissions.4. Are technology partners effectively used to accelerate change?Decarbonization leaders take a comprehensive approach to monitoring the evolving technology landscape while building out an ecosystem and integrated data platform. Consider how clients have teamed up with Paris-based data analytics company Kayrros to solve methane leakage detection by combining satellite monitoring, aerial surveillance and mobile sensors.Companies that can affirmatively answer these four basic questions will set themselves up to play both offense and defense ¡X and will emerge as leaders in the race to tackle the planet¡¦s top business challenge.',\n",

Moreover, the?country is ranked sixth in the list of the world¡¦s worst offenders?for dumping plastic waste into the sea according to Siam Commercial Bank\\'s Economic Intelligence Center.Tackling these interconnected issues quickly will take systemic change ¡X?and new ways of engaging and collaborating among stakeholders across the entire value chain ¡X?from policymakers and producers to consumers.The concept of a circular economy offers a way to rethink production and consumption on a systemic level. Given that opportunity, this spring our Bangkok Hub of Global Shapers ¡X?a youth-led network of Hubs initiated by the World Economic Forum ¡X?was selected as one of four cities to pilot a new initiative to support the development of circular economy solutions tailored to local needs through grassroots efforts. The initiative leverages the Forum¡¦s Scale360 methodology to bring business and innovation leaders together to use local efforts to scale global change.For months, our Shapers have worked to address how the circular economy could help tackle issues of plastic pollution and clean air in Bangkok and Thailand at large. At this early stage, such efforts have taught us the following key lessons that any city can leverage regarding how to prioritize and build early circular collaborations.To provide alternatives to single-use plastic (SUP), our hub kicked off a special project to map startups in Thailand offering working solutions to single-use plastic in the food sector. We compiled 30 Thailand-based startups that provide circular alternatives to single-use plastic, partnering with Deutsche Gesellschaft f?r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH (through its single-use plastic prevention project CAP SEA), Thailand Environment Institute (TEI), and ?ko Institut e.V. (a leading research organization).Building on these partnerships, the Bangkok Hub then collaborated with eco-INSTITUT Germany to analyze the credibility and actual impact of the products and materials supplied. This effort led to the development of the first \"SUP-Free\" catalog initiated by Global Shapers Bangkok and GIZ GmbH. The catalog, which will be shared with key stakeholders in Phuket, lists not only suppliers¡¦ stories, contact details and current portfolio of products, but also unit costs and minimum order quantities, making it easier for businesses to go plastic-free.This solution is a go-to living document and tool that can be developed further in the long term to support Phuket and other destinations as they move toward a greener and sustainable economic recovery. Such a resource can be made more robust over time and help change habits for suppliers while raising awareness and changing both business practices and consumer habits.In reviewing our own fieldwork, our hub realized certain members of the Thai public were educated and energized but not mobilized. For instance, a citizen-driven bill was in place, but only a handful knew ¡X?limited to economists, lawyers and other professionals. In many cities, action toward climate can come in pockets, limited to small groups with momentum never building. We saw an opportunity to mainstream existing action to better persuade policymakers.To address these gaps, the Hub is planning a social media campaign to build awareness about the citizen-driven Clean Air Bill, drafted by The Thailand Clean Air Network (Thai)¡¦s passionate group of volunteer lawyers, scientists and economists. The \"Clean Air Act\" intervention is a collaboration between volunteer-driven organizations, small startups, advertising agencies and members of international NGOs. The goal of the campaign is to collect 10,000 signatures to present the policy change proposal to the Thai parliament, The National Assembly of Thailand.As strict restrictions are reimposed in Greater Bangkok and several provinces in Thailand due to recent surges in coronavirus, social media is a key way to mobilize and engage supporters. The social media campaign also helps to quickly bridge gaps given the high connectivity of the public, bringing the topic closer to more people at a greater pace.With the support from the Royal Thai Government, the Hub is also helping to develop \"City Hack,\" a 72-hour, circular economy-themed hackathon. While most hackathons are attended by startups and young entrepreneurs, this event will also pull policymakers and urban planning experts into the design process of devising circular-minded products and services that address key issues facing Bangkok and Thailand.Following initial workshops with the support of the government, the Hub understood that innovation must also involve policymakers as their work can make or break interventions supporting a more \"circular\" economy. Using modern techniques such as design thinking and bringing all stakeholders together to exchange best practices can create new paths to innovation from elected leaders and regulators, inspiring them to have a \"circular mind\" when considering projects, strategic investments and collaborations.With each of these projects, synergies were key. After all, scaling change takes pursuing solutions that meet the overlapping needs of multiple stakeholders. To this end, we channeled our efforts into projects that mobilized the resources and interests of many groups simultaneously. For instance, finding plastic-free alternatives in our single-use plastic-free project created a much-needed solution for those in policy and public health while boosting economic growth and the visibility of local entrepreneurs. With City Hack, innovators will learn how to match their efforts to public sector needs while city leaders will better understand which stakeholders to consult at the planning stage of big initiatives.Identifying synergies starts with noting which stakeholders in different sectors (governments, companies and consumers) can drive circular solutions and mapping any inter-connectivity between their key issues. To balance varying needs and agendas, mapping out the \"big picture\" for stakeholders can be important, showing how a potential initiative factors in each group¡¦s concerns while proposing specific contributions each can put forward to create a circular economy environment.These interventions have developed genuine interest in the circular economy in Bangkok, particularly among Hub stakeholders and our social circles. Of course, much work must still be done. Thailand is in the early stages of considering how circular practices can protect resources and prevent waste. The systemic change that is needed will take many years. However, these early efforts to popularize the circular economy are key to the initial education process that can later lead to action across all sectors.By addressing issues across the entire value chain ¡X?producers, end users?and the overall external environment ¡X?interventions incubated and hatched by new initiatives we have built are merely the outset of a long-term collaboration with both private and public sector, one that will allow Global Shapers Bangkok?to drive the demand for circular solutions in Thailand and beyond.',\n",
              " 'The COVID-19 crisis has shown how deep inequalities make society as a whole more vulnerable ¡X providing important lessons for building resilience in an era of climate change. The people most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis are largely those who are also most vulnerable to climate change impacts:?lower-income and disadvantaged people, including women, communities of color and other marginalized ethnic groups, the elderly, informal workers and those in?essential but undervalued jobs?on the front lines.With millions infected,?more than half?the global workforce at immediate risk of losing their livelihoods and the number of people facing?acute hunger?potentially doubling to 265 million, the COVID crisis is worsening inequality, with dire consequences for our societies and economies. Often, the crisis is most acute for the poor in developing countries where livelihoods are precarious.Last year, a global wave of protests highlighted the urgent need to address climate action and social justice ¡X and the recent protests against racism in the United States and Europe also have underscored fundamental key issues of equity. As countries launch efforts to reboot their economies, they have a critical opportunity to pursue a course that is more sustainable and resilient ¡X and to achieve this shift, they also must put tackling inequality at its core.Here are four issues at the center of the COVID crisis for which recovery strategies can address inequality, the economic crisis and climate change all at once. While these issues by no means reflect all the ways in which responses to climate change and inequality intersect, they are central to the challenges that the COVID-19 crisis has laid bare.At least half the world¡¦s countries have included social protection policies to ensure basic income security and access to health care as part of their response to the COVID crisis. This includes adopting new social protection programs or expanding existing ones to provide access for excluded groups, such as informal workers, self-employed workers, migrants and the homeless. These measures are particularly essential for the 2 billion informal workers who lost 60 percent of their wages in the first month of the crisis. Many of these workers are women; in India 90 percent of working women are in the informal sector.Countries should build on these policies to develop or strengthen universal social protection systems that enhance resilience to shocks, including climate change. A range of social protection measures ¡X cash transfers, accessible insurance and employment guarantee schemes, for example ¡X also can help make communities more resilient to climate change, especially for the poorest groups such as smallholder farmers.In the second quarter of 2020, the world lost the equivalent of about 400 million full-time jobs, a devastating drop that has damaged the livelihoods of families everywhere. Investment in green, resilient activities such as sustainable infrastructure, clean energy and ecosystem restoration is fundamental to sustainably bring jobs back in the wake of the pandemic. The International Energy Agency has proposed a Sustainable Recovery Plan for energy sectors that would save or create 9 million jobs a year over the next three years.?These recovery efforts especially should target jobs toward those who are poorest and most vulnerable. In India, for example, where 400 million workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty, recovery can focus on opportunities in green sectors ¡X?11 million jobs in renewable energy alone ¡X but also will need to focus on providing poor workers with effective access to training programs. Expanding renewable energy also helps provide poor communities, especially rural ones, with energy access and essential services such as health care, water and sanitation.Recovery plans also can be designed to support just transition strategies for workers and communities dependent on sectors that need to shrink or adapt to reduce their carbon footprint and climate vulnerability. Job creation, income support, re-skilling programs and economic diversification initiatives should be integrated into recovery plans, including in countries hit by the recent oil price shock.This crisis also has shown the importance of improving wages, protection and working conditions in jobs that are critical to sustaining society and building resilience ¡X including in sectors such as health care, where workers play a key role in responding to climate impacts. Some governments, including those in France and Ontario, Canada, have granted health and social workers bonuses during the COVID crisis. However, many essential workers worldwide ¡X especially women and people of color ¡X have received limited financial compensation and health protections. Longer-term measures are necessary to support these workers and address gender equity, as women account for 70 percent of the 136 million people working in health and social work. As these workers play key economic and social roles, leaving them behind would undermine our societies as a whole.The COVID crisis has worsened food insecurity globally, squeezing many smallholder farmers and revealing just how vulnerable existing food systems are. In many countries, restricted imports of critical food supplies and a lack of workers to harvest crops have led to food shortages. In some African and Asian countries, farmers have been unable to get their products to market.These challenges to production and supply chains need to be addressed as extreme weather and other climate change impacts become more severe. To that end, recovery plans can channel investment in sustainable, resilient agriculture and food supply chains at the local, national and regional levels. Well-designed, climate-smart and agroecological practices are essential to strengthen food security, adapt to and prevent the worst impacts of climate change, and reduce ecosystem loss that is exacerbating the risks of diseases carried by animals that can infect humans, such as COVID-19. Restoring 395 million acres of degraded agricultural land could boost smallholder farmers¡¦ incomes in developing countries by 35 billion to 40 billion per year while providing additional food for nearly 200 million people. Forest restoration also can help reduce carbon emissions while boosting rural livelihoods and jobs, including in high-income countries.COVID-related lockdowns have caused a steep drop in the use of public transport, with significant reductions in revenue placing a severe strain on public transit agencies. If public transport is unavailable to many after the coronavirus crisis subsides, it would make unequal access to mobility even worse while hampering efforts to cut transport emissions and air pollution.As the recovery takes shape, boosting public and sustainable transport options is essential to advance public health and climate objectives while also addressing inequality and creating job intensive services. Nearly half the world¡¦s urban residents ¡X including 82 percent in sub-Saharan Africa ¡X lack convenient access to public transport. Recovery plans provide major opportunities to invest in equitable and sustainable mobility such as electric buses, bus rapid transit systems and better infrastructure for cycling and walking. For example, many cities already have extended bike paths during the crisis to ensure social distancing; these efforts can be continued and expanded.The COVID crisis has led to a significant increase in the use of virtual communications and teleworking, which can be part of broader strategies to reduce emissions, especially by reducing demand for carbon-based transport. However, the pandemic also has exposed the digital divide across economic groups and geographies as a new frontier of inequality, most glaringly seen with inadequate schooling for lower-income families. In both developed and developing countries, building out broadband and internet services to those with inadequate access should be part of COVID recovery strategies that can help slash emissions, generate jobs and reduce economic and social inequality.?The challenges ahead ¡X?but also the opportunities ¡X?are significant. Beyond the four areas highlighted here, there are also important intersections between COVID-19, climate change and inequality involving other issues such as air pollution, urban housing and planning, and access to clean water.As the recovery takes shape, significant investments in people and long-term sustainability will be needed from all levels of government and a range of institutions, including national and multilateral development banks and the IMF. More financial resources are essential, and we¡¦ll have to look at equitable fiscal approaches, including equitable fossil fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing, fair domestic taxation and debt relief or cancellation for vulnerable countries.As recovery plans are developed, public participation also will be essential. Building on efforts to develop citizens¡¦ assemblies on climate policies, we will need models of citizens¡¦ participation ¡X with a focus on voice and agency of vulnerable communities ¡X to make governance for climate action responsive to public demand for greater democracy and system change.As we emerge from the COVID crisis, we will need broad support for a revitalization of our economies and societies built on a sustainable, equitable vision for our future. That will be critical to equip our world to take on the climate and inequality challenges that lie ahead.',\n",
              " 'Providing funding to poorer nations to undertake climate action is not only a moral and legal responsibility for developed countries, but also a strategic investment in a cleaner and more resilient world. Such support pays dividends by reducing the severity and costs of climate impacts for people, including extreme weather, ecosystem loss and societal instability both at home and abroad.Over the last four years (see our coverage from 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020), Congress has sought to maintain U.S. finance for international climate action, in the face of repeated efforts by the Trump administration to drastically cut funding back. But while the United States has been treading water on climate finance, the rest of the world has moved ahead, and the climate crisis is only intensifying.In 2009, developed countries made a collective commitment to mobilize 100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries between 2020 and 2025. As the largest cumulative greenhouse gas emitter, the United States has not been doing its fair share towards this goal.It is time for the United States to not just catch up, but to lead on climate finance ¡X for the country\\'s own sake as well as for others\\'. Climate change is a global phenomenon with significant local implications. Over the past five years, the United States has suffered 600 billion in direct losses from climate and weather-related events. Yet just 2.5 billion, or 0.07 percent of the federal budget each year, supports international efforts to address climate change.President Joe Biden has made climate change a top priority, and this week his special envoy for climate, John Kerry, told the international community, \"We intend to make good on our climate finance pledge.\" Biden\\'s recent executive order, \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" charged his team to develop a climate finance plan in the next three months.There are four key areas of climate finance that the administration should prioritize to bolster U.S. influence and impact as it reengages in global climate action.First, it\\'s important to look at what the fiscal year 2021 spending package passed by Congress in December did for international climate funding. This provides the baseline from which the Biden administration must build.Hard work by many members of Congress ensured overall U.S. climate finance did not significantly decline during the Trump administration. But as other countries have continued to scale up their funding, the U.S. has fallen down the rankings. The Biden administration must make up for lost time by rapidly scaling up climate funding and restoring the country to a leading role.U.S. reengagement on climate finance is not only a matter of how much, but also where unding is allocated. The complex landscape of climate finance has many possible channels, but some have more impact than others. Here are five top priorities for the Biden administration on international climate finance:President Donald Trump stopped U.S. contributions to the?Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has a mandate to help countries build low-carbon, resilient economies and take ambitious action under the Paris Agreement. Biden has said he would \"recommit the United States to the Green Climate Fund,\" and it should be No. 1 on his list of international climate finance priorities.The fund gives developing countries an equal voice in decision-making, and it has some of the strongest policies of any financial institution promoting gender responsiveness and Indigenous peoples\\' rights. It delivers funding through a diverse range of more than 100 organizations, from major U.S. investors to local businesses and nonprofits in developing countries. While the GCF has faced problems with slow decision making in the past, a new voting procedure instituted in 2019 has led to far more efficient delivery. Last year the fund approved a record 2 billion for 37 projects, more than any other international climate fund.Obama pledged 3 billion to the GCF in 2014 but only delivered 1 billion before leaving office, meaning the United States still owes 2 billion from that original pledge. In 2019, most other developed countries made a new round of pledges, with many doubling their original commitments.Resumed U.S. contributions to the GCF would deliver the most diplomatic bang for the buck. The GCF was a key part of the grand bargain that underpinned the Paris Agreement: that poorer countries would undertake more climate action but needed increased support from richer countries to do so. Developing countries, as well as the U.S. climate movement, have made clear that ambitious backing for the GCF is a key test of Biden\\'s recommitment to global climate leadership.The GCF has significant support in Congress: for the first time last year, the House of Representatives requested funding for the GCF. With Democrats also gaining control of the Senate, and members of the pivotal Appropriations Committee backing the Fund, the potential for GCF appropriations never has looked better. To get back up to speed, Biden should deliver the outstanding 2 billion from the country\\'s existing pledge and make a new, more ambitious commitment of 6 billion to match peers who already have doubled their pledges.The United States should become a first-time contributor to the Adaptation Fund, which helps developing countries adapt to climate impacts. Like the GCF, the Adaptation Fund has an official role in implementing the Paris Agreement. Developing countries are strong champions of the Adaptation Fund because of its track record in quickly delivering funding to small-scale projects that make tangible differences to people\\'s lives. The fund also has pioneered innovative ways to give developing countries more say over how climate finance is spent, including giving developing countries a majority in its board and granting funding directly to recipient country institutions.A U.S. contribution to the Adaptation Fund would signal to the world that the Biden administration will fully and actively support the Paris Agreement, and that it understands the priorities of vulnerable countries. The Adaptation Fund is much smaller than the GCF, receiving just over 1 billion in cumulative contributions over 12 years. Germany is the largest contributor, pledging around 60 million each year. A U.S. contribution on that scale would provide a massive boost to the Adaptation Fund\\'s important work.Similarly, the United States should make a new pledge to the Least Developed Countries Fund?¡X which provides adaptation funding to the poorest countries ¡X at a similar level to the 51 million it pledged in 2015.In 2021, countries will begin negotiating the Global Environment Facility\\'s eighth replenishment, for 2022 to 2026. The United States should come prepared with an ambitious pledge that makes up for not increasing contributions at the last replenishment in 2018. Biden also should continue support for the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, and restore full funding for the IPCC and UNFCCC.Biden promised to \"fully integrate climate change into foreign policy.\" To ensure a coherent approach, his administration must coordinate across the government agencies that extend development assistance to other countries, including the Departments of State and Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. The administration should work with Congress to increase bilateral funding allocated in the annual appropriations bills for climate adaptation, renewable energy and sustainable landscapes.In addition to these specific allocations, the administration also should mainstream climate across all its development spending. This does not mean cutting spending from other priorities such as healthcare, education and gender equality, but that as part of an overall increase in the development assistance budget, all spending would take into account the impacts of projects on the climate ¡X and of climate change on projects. This includes ending overseas financing for fossil fuels as part of the administration\\'s commitment to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.Trump reversed previous efforts by the Obama administration to mainstream climate, so the Biden administration should work closely with Congress to ensure these reforms have longevity.The multilateral development banks are major climate finance contributors. But they also have a long history of financing fossil fuels. In 2018, these banks committed to align their activities with the Paris Agreement, but they have made slow progress. The heads of both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are Trump appointees, so this is perhaps unsurprising.The United States is a major shareholder in most multilateral development banks. The banks\\' leadership are likely to ask for increased funding from the Biden administration, which gives the United States significant influence. For example, last year House Financial Services Committee chair Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) secured important reforms to increase accountability and transparency of the World Bank\\'s private sector arm as part of a U.S. capital increase.The Biden administration and Congress are in a strong position to push multilateral development banks to move faster toward Paris alignment, including ending funding for fossil fuels, and ensuring their pandemic recovery funding helps countries rebuild cleaner, more resilient societies. The administration should use all the tools at its disposal, including updating the Treasury guidelines for how U.S. representatives vote in development banks.Biden\\'s Jan. 27 executive order provides a mandate to deliver on all four of these priorities. The administration\\'s forthcoming climate finance plan should set out concrete steps for how the United States will meet its responsibilities and become a leader in supporting developing countries to take ambitious action, which benefits both the United States and the world.',\n",
              " 'My work exposes me to some of the most forward-thinking companies and brands around the world. Many are at the forefront of the energy transition and are meeting or exceeding ambitious sustainability goals, while others are strongly committed and are eager to make demonstrable progress.?For corporations and global enterprises that fall into the latter category, establishing a foundational strategy or \"roadmap\" can be a key starting point. From my perspective, businesses might consider a few common steps in these sustainability roadmaps as they chart their own course toward end-to-end sustainability solutions. Understanding these steps can help organizations self-assess their own level of readiness and identify the types of expertise they must access in order to move forward.?(For help visualizing what an end-to-end sustainability solution might look like for your brand, check out this resource outlining paths to a greener supply chain.)Clear-cut goals allow organizations to define success and envision the steps leading up to it. While some companies are readily aware of precise sustainability targets, others need help understanding their existing carbon footprint and itemizing the desired outcomes.?Regulatory requirements may compel some of these goals, but compliance mandates aren¡¦t the only factor to consider. External incentives, internal values, stakeholder demands and economic forces in the energy market are all worth evaluating. There are often industry-wide or competitive considerations, especially if the sector in which a company participates has customers that value a sustainably produced product or service.Large enterprises have to take multi-faceted approaches that include both large and small considerations for different aspects of operations and the supply chain. In such an integrated solution, there are usually several possible levers to pull to implement an overarching decarbonization strategy.?For example, is replacing an existing power source with renewable energy the only goal or are emissions from operations and supply chains in scope? The former requires a relatively simple solution of procuring power from solar or wind projects, while the latter potentially calls for the addition of carbon offsets to address emissions that can¡¦t be avoided.?Challenges also vary by sector. An enterprise dealing in fast-moving consumer goods may be motivated to address the emissions of middle- and last-mile vehicles with electric vehicle infrastructure, while cloud data centers may look to onsite solar generation with behind-the-meter storage as a means of reducing reliance on fossil fuels.?Further, many organizations face unique challenges that can¡¦t be overcome with widely available turnkey energy products. These circumstances call for collaboration with like-minded companies or suppliers to co-create solutions that accelerate their decarbonization journey.Many companies have cause to pause at the commitment and investment timeframe of decarbonizing their operations. However, the previous step of matching challenges to solutions can present several options that allow these companies to start making progress toward long-term goals right away.Low-hanging fruit may come in the form of standard or structured renewable energy products. For example, renewable energy at scale is much more accessible now than in previous years. The levelized cost per unit of electricity from utility-scale onshore wind and solar plants respectively dropped 70 and 90 percent over the past decade.?While procurement mechanisms such as physical and virtual power purchase agreements (PPAs), leveraged by many corporations to quickly green their energy mix, are becoming more common, inherent complexities and risks must be understood when making that choice. Depending on a company¡¦s situation and needs, simpler solutions may be available such as bundling green attributes into a retail agreement, where the regulatory environment allows.?From the infrastructure side, distributed energy resource (DER) solutions can offer robust, actionable steps in an integrated plan to lessen facilities¡¦ overall energy consumption. Some of these programs operate on a subscription model, granting companies access to infrastructure and efficiency upgrades on a rolling payment basis, rather than requiring substantial upfront investment.?At this point, planning turns into execution, which is also dependent on the scope and scale of the company¡¦s operations and goals. First steps such as greening the energy mix can be implemented relatively quickly depending on a company¡¦s particular situation. However, at the enterprise scale, the integration effort of deploying strategies vertically and/or horizontally poses a longer-term challenge.?End-to-end sustainability requires procuring and deploying multiple energy products, along with an overarching vision for bringing them together, measuring their impact and ensuring goals are met. One way to streamline these efforts is to work with an energy company that can offer multiple solutions as well as the trading power and expertise to bring them to fruition.?For example, Shell Energy has the scale of supply, global footprint, scope of services and vision for the energy transition, which grants us the ability to create end-to-end solutions encompassing multiple energy products. Our customers benefit from assistance creating roadmaps of their own, as well as access to leading-edge solutions across North America and Shell¡¦s separate 24/7 trade desk for tailored renewable products and offsets. For help visualizing what an end-to-end sustainability solution might look like for your brand, check out this resource outlining paths to a greener supply chain.Regardless of which energy partner(s) a company chooses to work with, reviewing this sustainability roadmap can shed light on how well an organization is equipped to envision its low-emissions future.?For companies that don¡¦t know where to start, a collaborative approach is particularly important. By building relationships that combine resources and expertise, stakeholders can become better equipped to lay out a roadmap, establish benchmarks and tackle sustainability challenges with the most effective solutions.',\n",
              " 'How can advanced energy technologies save Californians from reliving the fustercluck of the Public Safety Power Shutoffs of 2019??This was the (paraphrased) central question of the California Energy Commission\\'s energy resilience forum?in Long Beach this week.The tone was both realistic and aspirational. The California Energy Commission (CEC) understands the urgency of the situation and gets California¡¦s position of leadership. It wants to be out front on the issue (or as out front as an institution can be in a society that started planning 20 years too late).The day left me hopeful about the suite of technological solutions available and reeling over the complexities of bringing them to scale. Here are the four conversations I¡¦d like to address to understand how we get there from here.?We¡¦re collectively coming to the realization that climate resilience is more valuable than just the cost of a watt. Last year¡¦s Public Safety Power Shutoffs revealed a sliver of the cost of inaction.?\"The effect of wildfires extend far beyond property damage and loss of life,\" said Adam Rose, a research professor at USC¡¦s Price School of Policy and director of CREATE, an organization that conducts economic analysis of terrorism events. \"Business interruptions start when a wildfire begins. But they continue until you¡¦ve recovered.\"In addition to the immediate halt of business, ripple effects occur through the economy ¡X including supply chain disruptions and loss of productivity. Just as important (but harder to quantify) are the human costs, such as displaced populations, post-traumatic stress disorder and the rise of illness and disease associated with the fires. All these things add up.?Like other kinds of debt, this debt compounds if you don¡¦t deal with it, and it can distort the true cost of decisions, In panel discussions about paying for system upgrades, very smart people correctly asserted that when we look at the cost of resilience holistically, we can¡¦t afford not to act.?The problem is if our investment in resilience works, we don¡¦t know the costs we¡¦re avoiding. What¡¦s more, our political system is designed to reward short-term thinking. Politicians often deprioritize long-term planning for quick wins, deferring investments in upgrades and maintenance in vulnerable systems ¡X which is actually borrowing from the future. Journalist Alexis Madrigal refers to this as \"technical debt.\"\"Like other kinds of debt, this debt compounds if you don¡¦t deal with it, and it can distort the true cost of decisions,\" wrote Madrigal in The Atlantic. \"If you ignore it, the status quo looks cheaper than it is. At least until the off-the-books debt comes to light.\"We all know failure to be prepared will result in untold economic impacts. But how can we transform that understanding to shift public funds and investment to prevention, rather than reaction?In California, we¡¦re halfway to the next fire season, yet we haven¡¦t seen the deployment of critical infrastructure at the scale needed to protect communities.?\"The clock¡¦s running right now,\" said Tom Tansy, chairman of SunSpec Alliance, a trade association that works on information standards for distributed energy, during one of Tuesday¡¦s panels. \"The fires season starts in September, and we¡¦re still talking about mobilization plans. It doesn¡¦t seem like we¡¦re going to do much this year. It seems like we missed a whole nother season.\"This isn¡¦t for lack of conversation, technology or understanding. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is in the midst of a proceeding to address this issue. While a step in the right direction, in some ways this proves the point: We¡¦re awaiting outcomes of a slow, bureaucratic process at a time when we should be galloping toward deploying new technologies at scale.?\"The regulatory friction across the stack is overwhelming for emerging technologies in California,\" said Jim Mason, founder and CEO of All Power Labs, a company with a biomass gasification technology.?This is different from Europe and Asia, countries that make it easier for small-scale generation to connect to the grid, according to Mason. For example, one of All Power Lab¡¦s machines costs 50,000 while connecting it to the grid in California could cost 500,000, according to Mason.?\"You get put through this totally complicated intertie process that just crushes the economic viability of the proposition,\" he said.?The complex regulatory environment adds soft costs to distributed energy deployments ¡X even for technologies that are tried and true.?For example, in California, the paperwork and requirements to install rooftop solar can take two to six months, according to JP Ross, director of local development, electrification and innovation at East Bay Community Energy. In the meantime, it isn¡¦t uncommon for potential clients to get cold feet during the process. It takes us a day, maybe two days, to install solar and batteries. But it takes two months to get all the permitting and interconnection, and customers cancel in that time. \"It takes us a day, maybe two days, to install solar and batteries. But it takes two months to get all the permitting and interconnection, and customers cancel in that time, and all those costs just get loaded onto the next customer,\" said Audrey Lee, vice president of energy services at SunRun.??Those soft costs add up. By way of comparison, in Australia, a client can install solar in less than three weeks for around 80 cents a watt. In California, the cost balloons to 3.50 to 4 per watt.?And that¡¦s rooftop solar, a technology already deployed on a million homes. The soft costs associated with upgrades for electric heat pumps, electric vehicle charging stations or microgrids are prohibitive for many customers.?\"The technology is pretty ready; the infrastructure needs work, but we¡¦ll get there ¡X but the soft costs are really going to slow things down,\" Ross said.?Utility business models are the \"elephant in the room,\" according to Lee.?Deploying new technologies requires coordination and cooperation among utilities, building owners and technology providers. Investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which serve 72 percent of Americans and three-quarters of Californians, have a responsibility to shareholder profits that may not align with welcoming new technologies.?The CPUC, tasked with regulating utilities in the state, works to align the incentives. But the process, according to Mason, is slow-going, as utilities weigh into proceedings and can file lawsuits to impede the transition.?\"It¡¦s been decades of pushing the IOUs inch by inch,\" Mason said. \"It¡¦s totally different when you¡¦re working in Germany or Italy. If the state wants to try a new policy, it¡¦s not this battle to the death.\"The path forward is unclear, although some officials have offered suggestions in the wake of Pacific Gas and Electric¡¦s bankruptcy proceedings.',\n",
              " 'There are numerous reasons so many organizations across the globe are working to reduce their environmental impacts. These motives include, but aren¡¦t limited to, meeting consumer demands, increasing efficiency, meeting regulatory requirements, adding brand value, attracting talent and creating new business opportunities.?All of these point to the fact that practicing sustainability is a fundamental undertaking for corporations, not some short-term fad. In fact, researchers expect the renewable energy market alone to exceed 2.15 trillion by 2025.?As the industry evolves, there is more accessibility to renewable energy solutions, which can be a double-edged sword for executives in the process of introducing or advancing sustainability efforts into their corporate cultures. On one hand, there are more options than ever. But conversely, achieving the best energy transition blueprint for your business can be complicated or even overwhelming.?Consequently, here are four items business leaders might consider as they develop their path to setting and achieving their energy sustainability goals.?Businesses need a solid understanding of where they stand before determining where they can go and how fast. For example, through comprehensive submetering and analytics, you can develop a deeper understanding of what is driving energy consumption and at what time of day. ?Once your organization has a clear energy consumption picture, you can identify and evaluate opportunities for improvement. This information empowers company leadership to develop sustainability goals with confidence.?When setting your sustainability goals, make sure you have the tools to measure progress. These tools can also help identify additional improvement opportunities and incremental phases of progression.?In addition to carbon reduction and cost elements of energy sustainability goals, you should consider other drivers and ambitions. For example, we¡¦ve seen businesses initiate solar power projects at their corporate headquarters because they wanted customers to see the panels. For them, visibility was more valuable than any potential cost savings.When creating a plan for achieving your goals incorporate the technology available and what might be accessible in the future, your regulatory environment and commercial progression for each element. For example, if a company wants to achieve carbon neutrality by a certain date, and its operating multi-class internal combustion engine (ICE) fleets, what solutions are available and what others are anticipated? Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) could be one economically feasible near-term solution for a portion of the fleet. Might biofuels be an interim solution for other portions? How might hydrogen or compressed natural gas solutions align with goals and needs? Researching these potential solutions can help you understand the timeline and roadmap for meeting your goals.Even companies new to sustainability initiatives have a variety of options. They might start by looking for opportunities to optimize their energy use. Often, the most effective way to start becoming more sustainable is by reducing the amount of energy used. Typical entry-point energy solutions include:Co-optimization Implementing multiple solutions can help to improve and accelerate energy cost and carbon intensity improvements. Returning to our EV example, behind-the-meter energy solutions can help you manage EV energy use. Processes such as smart charging, energy load management and dynamic power sharing often help prevent your demand charges from skyrocketing.When contemplating renewable energy procurement, an organization should also consider a portfolio of diverse products and solutions. For instance, developing a mix of renewable energy credits (RECs) and Renewable Energy Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) products across markets and locations can help to manage costs. These portfolios usually provide options to adjust the solution mix as technologies, regulations and markets evolve. Blending your options and taking advantage of innovation can help mitigate your financial risk and preserve optionality over the long run.Some businesses have the resources to monitor technological advancements in sustainability and manage such research and tracking. Others rely on trusted suppliers or advisers to help keep them informed of emerging technologies and their potential use cases. At Shell Energy, we provide guidance as part of our relationship, to assist our customers with achieving their ultimate goals. Tracking progression and anticipating timing of commercially viable solutions can help define and refine action plans through the energy transition journey.Regulations will evolve through the energy transition. In response, it¡¦s important to stay in tune with these changes and to adjust your plans accordingly. In addition, it¡¦s wise to stay up to date with programs and incentives across the relevant markets.It is also helpful to follow potential changes in sustainability reporting practices and protocols and to assess how they may affect both your goals and roadmap. For example, there is growing interest and ambition for moving past the measurement of MWhs and RECs to measuring the carbon intensity of the energy your business consumes. With this, there is impetus toward the development and use of carbon tracking tools. With progress, carbon intensity measurement will likely increase the granularity and sophistication of accepted practices and protocols. You will need to anticipate and incorporate these principles into goal definitions, sustainability roadmaps and action plans.Another example is the building momentum around 24/7 renewable energy delivery. Again, with progression, this may drive the need to adjust your sustainability ambitions. Shell Energy¡¦s wind and solar projects in North America add more than 1,000 GWh of carbon-free energy to the grid each year. Combined with our deep risk management capabilities, these assets position us well to help our customers progress toward more ambitious sustainability goals.Similar to how we help our customers with technology trends, Shell Energy personnel bring understanding and insights regarding the evolving practices, protocols and regulatory landscape. We do this because we know the amount of resources that can be involved in learning about your energy use, let alone implementing the best practices for sustainability.? ?Shell Energy can help you navigate the complexities of the energy transition.',\n",
              " \"A whopping 8 million tons of plastic winds up in the ocean each year, endangering wildlife and polluting ecosystems. This number is expected to grow ¡X a recent report from Pew Charitable Trust suggests that without improvements to waste management, 90 million tons of plastic could enter the world's aquatic ecosystems by 2030. Plastics have even been found in people's bodies and in the air.The problem has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the necessary increase of single-use plastics for personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and shields, some governments and business have delayed or scrapped plastic bag and packaging bans. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, WRI and UNEP found that more than 100 countries regulated single-use plastic bags.Since the pandemic, 50 U.S. cities moved away from plastic regulation. In December, Vancouver, Canada postponed fees for disposable cups and its ban on plastic shopping bags for more than one year. Starbucks and Dunkin' put on hold the use of reusable containers. And some recycling programs were shelved in the United States and European Union because of budget cuts due to the pandemic.While the increased use of plastic is necessary to fight the pandemic, particularly for PPE, countries need to ensure these emergency changes do not derail long-term progress on the passage of laws aimed at reducing plastic pollution. If countries want to build back better after COVID-19, legislative reform on curbing plastic waste is an essential part of the agenda.A new legislative guide launched today by UNEP and WRI digs deep into how the law can be used to tackle plastic pollution and support a circular plastics economy.Policy shifts can reduce plastic pollution by incentivizing changes in both business and consumer behavior, as well as in plastic design, alternatives and recycling. Here are four policy and legal approaches from UNEP and WRI's guide that countries can use to reduce their plastic waste permanently:Bans and restrictions on single-use plastic products (that directly prohibit their production, distribution or use) are some of the most widely used and successful legal mechanisms by governments. Some of their success has been due to the flexibility of ban legislation in allowing for exemptions for medical products and other necessary use while promoting the use of alternative products such as cloth or paper bags.The guide also outlines potential unintended consequences that lawmakers must be aware of when enacting and enforcing bans.Governments also can impose taxes to deter the production or use of single-use plastics, or offer tax breaks, subsidies and other fiscal incentives to encourage alternatives to single-use plastic products.Portugal and Denmark have used these economic instruments effectively to increase the use of reusable and recycled products, respectively. Taxes and incentives can apply to particular businesses (such as supermarkets or plastic producers) or particular products (such as plastic coffee cup lids or soda bottles).Governments also can use economic incentives to encourage manufacturers to adopt alternatives to plastic (such as using sugar cane to create plastic bags) or to create revenue that can fund plastic waste clean-up efforts.Product standards, certifications and labeling requirements can be designed to educate the public on the environmental impacts of plastic, and on the health and safety hazards involved in their production and use. Legislation on single-use plastic products can set standards on material composition, reusability, recoverability (to ensure the product can be recycled), biodegradability and ensuring products can be composted. This approach can support consumer choice of sustainable products.Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs can ensure that manufacturers maintain responsibility for single-use plastic products throughout the whole life cycles of those products. These legislative tools can guarantee more sustainable designs by holding manufacturers responsible for single-use plastics throughout the collection, recovery, recycling or reuse of their products.There is no silver bullet to solving the world's plastic problem. It will require governments at both the national and sub-national levels to tackle the regulation of single-use plastic products, determining what policy approaches they want to use and what type of legislation will support their objectives.Challenges are ahead: a lack of investment and support for the recycling industry to make it competitive; increased production of virgin single-use plastic; and minimal producer responsibility in many countries outside of the EU. There is also no global legal framework to facilitate collective action from multiple countries, no common agreement on which plastics should be phased out, and pressure from plastic manufacturers on lawmakers not to advance on legislation. But to advance action, we need to be deliberate in adopting multi-pronged solutions.Legislators must consider and adopt different, complementary approaches to be most effective, including bans and restrictions, economic instruments, information standards and labeling, and extended producer responsibility including reuse, recycling and deposit-refund schemes. Supplementary efforts that support these approaches are also essential, such as consumer education programs, public procurement requirements, investment in waste management infrastructure and public-private partnerships.The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the importance of the short-term use of plastic to curb outbreaks and help people feel safe. But there is no time to have a slow reckoning on the long-term issue of plastic waste. We need increased ambition and innovation by governments, companies and civil society, as well as the thoughtful adoption of a variety of preventative policy and legislative measures to address the scale of the problem.\",\n",
              " 'President Joe Biden committed during his campaign to hold a world leaders¡¦ summit on climate change during his first 100 days in office. Now that promise is being carried out April 22-23 with the Leaders Summit on Climate.At this gathering, the Biden administration intends to galvanize efforts by the world¡¦s major economies \"to reduce emissions during this critical decade to keep a limit to warming of 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees F) within reach.\" Themes also will include elevating the?economic benefits of climate action, including job creation, as well as the importance of mobilizing public and private finance, addressing the need for adaptation and resilience to climate impacts, incorporating nature-based solutions, deploying and spurring transformational technologies, and showcasing subnational and business leaders on climate action.Forty world leaders have been invited to take part, including 17 major economies responsible for about 80 percent of global emissions and global GDP, as well as some countries that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change or at the leading edge of ambitious action.The summit will serve as a critical global milestone on the road to the COP26 U.N. climate summit in November, ahead of which countries are expected to put forward stronger national climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. It also will be a prime opportunity for the United States to reestablish itself as a leader in global climate diplomacy.Here are four key things that need to happen for the Leaders Summit on Climate to be a success:Biden committed to announce a new emissions-reduction target for 2030 at or before the summit. This target will be part of the U.S. national climate commitment under the Paris Agreement, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). To tackle the climate challenge and help spur a strong and equitable economy, the Biden administration should commit to cut emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. This is also a key opportunity for the United States to demonstrate that it will lead on cutting highly potent methane emissions.Analysis?from a range of organizations shows that a 50 percent target can be achieved cost effectively with existing technologies and would provide a major boost in jobs and innovation across a range of sectors, including renewable energy, sustainable transport and electric vehicles, industry and agriculture. For example, rapid electrification of the economy, essential for reducing emissions, could support up to 25 million good-paying jobs over the next 15 years and save the average household up to 2,000 annually on energy costs and better health outcomes. Emissions reductions also would help the United States avoid the economic costs of climate damages.In December, Congress passed major energy legislation that offers a solid foundation to build upon, with provisions to phase down the use of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) super-pollutants that are used in refrigeration and air conditioning, as well as expand investments in wind, solar, the electricity grid, energy storage, weatherization of low-income housing and energy efficiency upgrades of schools and federal buildings.In addition, more than 1,000 scientists called for Biden to cut emissions in half by 2050, and a group of major businesses with more than 1.4 trillion in combined annual revenue rallied behind an ambitious U.S. NDC.Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. federal government sat on the sidelines (or worse) for four long years. A sufficiently bold U.S. 2030 emissions-reduction target coupled with increased financial support for developing countries are essential ingredients to unlock bolder action from other nations. (See more on climate finance below.)Countries especially well positioned to announce stronger climate targets at the summit are those that have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions around mid-century, but have yet to put forward a 2030 NDC aligned with their long-term emissions goal. This includes Japan, South Korea, Canada and China.Japan and South Korea announced 2030 emissions-reduction targets last year that did not align with their 2050 net-zero goals. However, both countries since have said they will submit more ambitious NDCs ahead of COP26. Meanwhile, Canada has not yet put forward its plan, but indicated it will announce an enhanced 2030 emissions target by the summit.China also has not yet submitted its national climate commitment under the Paris Agreement. At or before the Leaders Climate Summit, China should make clear its intention to deliver a 2030 target that aligns with its pledge to reach carbon neutrality before 2060. China¡¦s recently adopted 14th Five Year Plan, which sets out the country¡¦s economic strategy, did not signal that it will ramp up efforts enough to reach net-zero emissions. Strengthening its NDC this year, along with sectoral and provincial plans, are opportunities for the country to reassure the world that it is serious about addressing the climate crisis. In addition to reining in CO2 emissions, China should set a target to limit non-CO2 emissions, including potent greenhouse gases methane and hydrofluorocarbons. This is especially important for China: If its non-CO2 emissions were a country, it would be the seventh-largest emitter of total GHGs in the world. WRI research shows many cost-effective opportunities for China to curb these potent GHGs across its economy, from cooling systems and rice cultivation to wastewater management.Other countries ¡X such as India, Indonesia and South Africa ¡X should use this global platform to raise their ambition as well. While they may not be ready to deliver their national plans at the summit, it is essential that all countries signal their commitment to bolder climate action ahead of COP26 and contribute to global efforts to avoid dangerous and costly climate impacts. In the case of countries such as Brazil and Mexico, the summit is an important opportunity to highlight the role of subnational governments in carrying forward strong climate action.The Biden administration said it will produce a climate finance plan on how the United States will strategically use financial institutions to assist developing countries in undertaking ambitious climate action. The plan, expected to be released around the time of the summit, will help lay the ground for the leaders¡¦ gathering. Supporting developing countries in installing clean energy, protecting forests and building resilience to increasingly damaging climate impacts is essential.The climate finance plan should indicate how the United States will scale its climate finance to catch up with the efforts of other major donors, who contribute more on a per-capita and share-of-gross-national-income basis. The plan also must include a recommitment to the Green Climate Fund, including setting out how the country will deliver the 2 billion in unpaid funding pledged in 2014 and making a new pledge to match other nations that recently doubled their contributions.Increased climate finance ambition from the United States can put pressure on other developed countries to come with new climate finance commitments, too. For example, Canada and Italy are the lowest providers of climate finance in the G7 and should do more to catch up to their peers. France and Japan also should increase their grant-based climate finance which, at less than 5 percent of their bilateral funding, is far too little to meet those needs that aren¡¦t well-suited to loan financing. And all developed countries should increase their adaptation finance to reach a balance with mitigation funding called for in the Paris Agreement.The Biden administration¡¦s finance plan also will need to address how the country will use its own institutions, such as the Development Finance Corporation, and push international ones such as the World Bank to increase finance for climate action and shift funding away from activities not aligned with the Paris Agreement ¡X especially fossil fuels.The summit is also a key moment for other countries to make clear how they will stop financing harmful activities ¡X particularly ending financing for coal. China, South Korea and Japan are the three biggest remaining public funders of coal plant construction worldwide, currently financing 84 gigawatts (GW) in construction in countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and South Africa. They each have indicated intentions to move away from overseas coal financing, and with recipient countries increasingly reorienting their energy development plans away from coal, it is time for a full end to public coal finance.More than a year since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have spent 16 trillion to respond to the crisis. While a few countries, mostly in Europe, have seized the opportunity to address the economic crisis and climate change together, most COVID-19 stimulus measures are propping up the business-as-usual economy. In the past year, governments announced more stimulus support for fossil fuels than for clean energy. This is a terrible misstep: Research shows a dollar spent on clean energy infrastructure or ecosystem conservation creates more jobs and has an economic return two to seven times higher than if it were spent on unsustainable sectors. After a drop in global carbon dioxide emissions for most of last year because of lockdowns, by December, emissions already had crept up to levels higher than they were in December 2019.The Leaders Summit on Climate offers a chance for the world to reset and commit to a more climate-friendly, resilient and just recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As host, the United States has a responsibility to set the tone. Recent developments show it is doing so. With the recent proposal of the American Jobs Plan, the Biden administration is aiming to create millions of jobs and invest more than 1 trillion in climate action, clean energy and environmental justice.Other major economies should share how they, too, will take advantage of the jobs and economic gains from clean energy, nature-based solutions and other low-carbon projects, while stopping the bail-out of carbon-intensive businesses. If governments commit to green recovery, these packages can form the foundation for stronger NDCs and ambitious action in the coming decade, building the necessary clean energy infrastructure to decarbonize the economy and set the stage for resilient economies of the future.The Leaders Summit on Climate comes on the heels of a U.N. report outlining how countries¡¦ emissions-reduction commitments are collectively falling far short of what¡¦s needed to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change. But that doesn¡¦t paint the full picture, as emitters representing 75 percent of global emissions either haven¡¦t submitted their plans yet (including the United States, China and India) or pledged to resubmit stronger plans this year (including Japan, Canada and South Korea). This gathering offers an opportunity for the world¡¦s largest economies to either announce ambitious new climate targets or at least signal that they will adopt stronger plans ahead of the COP26 negotiations.',\n",
              " 'In two months, 17.8 percent of the clean energy workforce disappeared. And things will get worse before they get better ¡X especially without policy support.?That¡¦s according to new analysis from Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), which calculated 594,300 clean energy workers lost their jobs in March and April. That means we just deleted all of the clean energy jobs created since 2017. And no, this number doesn¡¦t include furloughs or reduced layoffs.These job losses have been faster and worse than anticipated. In a similar analysis last month, E2 and partners forecast that the United States could see 500,000 jobs lost by the end of June. The experts expect 850,000 job losses in the first half of 2020. That¡¦s 17 times the number of all coal workers in the country.?At a time when we¡¦re seeing record-smashing unemployment figures in many industries, it¡¦s easy for the terrible news to blur together. But it¡¦s worth considering why clean energy, in particular, is an industry that will support us if we support it. Especially at a time when oil and gas companies are lining up for handouts while Washington¡¦s latest relief package shows no love for renewable energy.?In the Before Times, the clean energy sector was setting the curve for workforce development. It was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the country with a 10.4 percent increase in jobs since 2010. At the start of the year, it employed more than 3.3 million Americans. That is to say, once jump-started, the clean energy industry can hold its own.?Clean energy also has a rising-tide-all-boats element I love. Consider:?In the words of Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, on a press call, \"Clean energy can get the most people back to work in the most occupations in the least amount of time. Why wouldn¡¦t we do that?\"Let¡¦s take a look back.?In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act dedicated 90 billion to clean energy (about 10 percent of the stimulus package). That supported the creation of 900,000 clean energy jobs between 2009 and 2015, created hundreds of new companies (including game-changers such as Tesla) and weatherized more than 1 million homes (meaning people spent less on energy during the Great Recession).?We also learned the sector is hyper-responsive to stimulus money. A report from the Department of Economics and Political Economy Research Institute in 2009 shows that clean energy created roughly 2.8 times the number of jobs as oil and gas on a dollar-by-dollar basis.?And that was before the sector matured. Since then, the cost of solar fell by 85 percent and wind by 49 percent. Wind and solar is now the cheapest form of energy for two-thirds of the world.?It¡¦s hard to use historical data to project the future for disruptive technologies. Suffice it to say, it stands to reason that stimulus investments made today would go further in both the number of jobs created and the benefits of clean energy.?Clean energy investments are key to making low-income communities more energy-secure.?According to the Energy Information Administration, about a third of U.S. households face challenges paying energy bills and are disproportionately Latino or African American. These households spend about 7.2 percent of income on energy ¡X more than twice the national average, despite having smaller homes.?Clean energy upgrades ¡X such as energy efficiency retrofits or rooftop solar ¡X would be a gift that keeps giving during shaky economic times to disadvantaged communities.Further, a shift away from dirty energy would address issues of environmental racism. Nothing is more regressive than air pollution. Our transportation systems spiral through poor communities; our dirty energy infrastructure (from coal plants to oil refineries) is next door to those that are already systemically disadvantaged.?Pollution is part of a much larger negative feedback loop. With higher rates of respiratory issues, more sick days, high medical bills, the cycle of poverty is even tougher to escape. It also increases the risk of death from coronavirus.?It¡¦s worth noting that the clean energy sector has a ton of room for improvement when it comes to the diversity of the workforce. In energy efficiency, for example, most workers are male (76 percent) and white (78 percent). Some organizations are working transforming the workforce to look more like the country, such as GRID Alternatives and Green For All. My two cents: stimulus efforts would be well-suited to correct this imbalance. ?The COVID-19 crisis sure exposed a ton of fragility in our economy and logistics systems, huh??This shift in thinking is getting people and companies to think about the importance of resilience on multiple fronts. As the west prepares for another fire season, the south buttons down for hurricanes and the midwest is bracing for biblical flooding, folks are starting to consider what could happen when crises compound. And they don¡¦t want to do it in the dark.?With clean energy workers hungry for jobs, now seems a unique moment to make our grid, buildings and communities more energy-resilient. We have the labor; we have access; all we need is the capital.?Another COVID lesson: Inaction is really expensive.?Prioritizing energy security and resilience has the desired side effect of reducing emissions, which is imperative to slow the larger and slower climate crisis. Every 1 invested in resilience today saves us multifold in the future, perhaps as high as tenfold.?It¡¦s no secret that I¡¦ve long been a believer in the clean economy. As we peer over the cliff of this thing called an economy, my convictions have grown stronger. We have an unprecedented opportunity to write a new future. It would be criminal for our path forward not to include robust support for the clean energy industry.',\n",
              " 'In his first week in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that gives federal agencies 90 days to devise a plan that fully transitions the federal fleet¡¦s roughly 650,000 vehicles ¡X including about 225,000 postal vehicles, 173,000 military vehicles and 245,000 civilian vehicles ¡X into \"clean and zero-emission vehicles for Federal, State, local, and Tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the United States Postal Service.\" While some of these vehicles may include hydrogen, the majority likely will be electric vehicles (EVs). As such, this executive order is a critical first step to getting the on-the-ground momentum for a major electric vehicle transition.While the federal proclamation may be a simple concept, executing it will be challenging. A limited variety of EVs is available today, and creating new EV models ¡X even when manufacturers are willing to take on the substantial investments and risks involved ¡X can take more than five years. This can be especially challenging considering that the federal fleet has a massive variety of vehicles of all shapes and sizes, as well as both on- and off-road and light-, medium- and heavy-duty applications. Installing the necessary charging infrastructure and ensuring adequate energy supply also could take many years in areas with grid capacity constraints.The logistical challenges of procuring vehicles and charging hardware, energizing parking lots, getting permits, installing infrastructure, training drivers and maintenance staff, and much more creates a Herculean task, which is largely why it hasn¡¦t been done yet. To add further complexity, the administration will need to prevent unintended consequences, such as continued emissions from exporting used vehicles, to achieve the best possible environmental, economic and social outcomes.Here are four recommendations, informed by WRI¡¦s electric mobility work, to achieve those best outcomes from the federal fleet transition plan:The federal fleet, which consists of many types of fleets, is intended to serve various functions across the nation. Many of these vehicles are parked in urban areas, but some are also located in rural locations such as national parks and remote national forests. This makes it unlikely that they will be in the necessary range to completely rely on centralized fleet chargers.Ensuring robust public charging infrastructure will be necessary to keep these new vehicles running, requiring the federal government to be involved in developing a broad and sweeping national public plan. This roadmap should be developed with as many perspectives as possible to ensure it is comprehensive, provides the most holistic solutions and addresses the most pressing and urgent needs through the prudent use of federal funds. To help support policymakers, WRI leverages third-party economic analyses and modeling studies to assess the long-term impact of different EV adoption scenarios.In the past, WRI has helped inform greenhouse gas and efficiency standards for vehicles, zero-emission vehicle standards, low-carbon fuel standards and purchase incentives as part of our electric mobility work. WRI¡¦s New Climate Federalism project also provides recommendations on the appropriate involvement of state, federal and local governments when transitioning to EVs.Charging numerous EVs at the same time and in the same location, such as at a federal fleet facility, could cause issues with the local grid. It also potentially could lead to high electricity costs due to demand charges and expensive energy service upgrades. EV infrastructure planning adds complexity to an already arduous task for most fleet managers and their electric utility distribution engineer counterparts. Long lead times and high connection costs could be a major bottleneck for many federal fleet electrification projects that depend on traditional electricity service.Electrifying federal fleets may require out-of-the-box solutions such as on-site microgrids, energy storage, solar and demand charge management strategies to eliminate some cost and timeline barriers. The U.S. Department of Energy¡¦s Office of Electricity and many federally funded national labs could play a central role in adapting these approaches to the varying needs and geographies of the federal fleet.Another option to help alleviate grid constraints is to optimize EV charging loads to match peak renewable energy generation. This also will help tackle climate change by aligning the charging times to overlap with the cleanest forms of energy generation and reducing consumption of fossil fuel-based generation. And because vehicles are typically parked over 90 percent of the time, they can be used as an alternative to stationary storage by \"soaking up\" excess renewable generation, preventing curtailment of those resources and supporting new renewable energy deployment.If the EVs procured by the General Services Administration and others are bidirectionally capable (they can charge and discharge energy), the excess battery capacity could serve the dual functions of providing energy back to the grid during peak usage periods and creating local resilience benefits for emergency shelters, first responders and hospitals during disaster recovery. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could play a critical role here in enabling new vehicle-to-grid aggregator wholesale power market participation via FERC Order No. 2222.During the transition to EVs, the federal government will have to phase out thousands of old, non-electric vehicles. If the federal government sells the used vehicles to the private sector, they could get exported to countries without strict pollution or safety standards. This could result in a global net negative outcome in terms of air pollution, climate emissions and road safety. The federal government should plan to permanently remove these fleet vehicles from the roads and recycle those materials as part of this process.Biden¡¦s proclamation to electrify the federal fleet dovetails with similar recent actions: an executive order in California, GM¡¦s announcement to electrify all vehicles by 2035 and WRI¡¦s goal to electrify all U.S. school buses by 2030, to name a few. Although it will be difficult, this shift to EVs is a massively ambitious undertaking that can succeed.While these four recommendations are essential to an effective transition of the federal fleet, they are not the only steps that would benefit the plan. Other fleet transition plan components could include:WRI is tackling these and many other challenges through our electric mobility practice. There are many opportunities to leverage the buying power of the federal government to reduce the supply chain costs of the current EV market and provide the leadership, guidance and investment signals to the industry that are required for an equitable and comprehensive EV transition in a relatively short time.If the U.S. federal government figures out how to address these challenges, it could provide a massive kickstart to the EV transition and serve as a beacon to many other fleets who aspire to begin their electrification journey, both in the United States and elsewhere. Documenting and publishing lessons learned, co-locating infrastructure, sharing procurement and negotiation services and providing individualized advice could go a long way to helping other fleets electrify. Success from the new administration in this quest could prove to be a victory in addressing climate change challenges and paving the way for broader electric vehicle implementation.',\n",
              " 'We¡¦re all familiar with the role forests play when it comes to providing a sustainable source of food, energy and raw materials, and locking away CO2 emissions.But perhaps we¡¦re less knowledgeable about the potential of forests of seaweed growing in the oceans.A type of seaweed known as kelp is being developed for its nutritional value and its ability to absorb and lock away huge quantities of carbon dioxide. Seaweed absorbs CO2 more effectively than trees. It also improves water quality by extracting harmful nutrients such as nitrogen from the sea.These benefits are familiar to a new generation of oceanic entrepreneurs. They¡¦re working to preserve the world¡¦s marine ecosystems, while playing a key role in combating food insecurity and climate change.Here are four companies rising to the ocean challenge:Kelp Blue runs giant underwater farms where it grows seaweed crops that are harvested for agri-foods, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The kelp also absorbs large quantities of CO2. With a mission to \"re-wild\" the ocean and capture millions of tonnes of CO2 annually by 2050, Kelp Blue¡¦s sustainability credentials are reinforced by the fact that no fertilizers, pesticides, fresh water or land are used in its production processes.Kelp Blue is in the pilot phase of the project, which it hopes to eventually replicate in offshore locations across the world. The government of Namibia has granted environmental clearance for the company to start farming off its coast, a location that has perfect conditions for seaweed cultivation.This Indian company is all about scaling up and mechanizing tropical seaweed farming. It produces biomass for fuel and sustainable raw materials for industries that span agri-foods, health supplements, cosmetics, bioplastics and polymers. It has secured patents across the value chain.Sea6 Energy has designed what it calls \"SeaCombine\" ¡X?a tractor-like vehicle that sows seeds and harvests tropical sea plants off-shore, currently in India and Indonesia.The Institute is developing a biofilter network, in partnership with Central Queensland University¡¦s Coastal Marine Ecosystem Centre. The system will be used to remove nitrogen and CO2 from the Great Barrier Reef.It¡¦s a pioneering project that caught the attention of the World Economic Forum and was featured at the?Davos Agenda in 2021.Cascadia Seaweed, based on Canada¡¦s Vancouver Island, is focused on bringing its ocean bounty to more dinner tables. It hosted the Canadian province¡¦s inaugural Seaweed Days Festival in May. The U.N.¡¦s senior adviser on the global impact on oceans was there to see for himself the benefits that the new ocean economy can have in the real world.The two-year-old Canadian company has farms offshore. It¡¦s also built its own seed nursery.Cascadia grows four types of seaweed, but plans to expand into more varieties in time. The company is motivated to provide increasing work opportunities for the region¡¦s indigenous communities and has forged partnerships with local tribes as it expands its enterprise along the coast of British Columbia.These start-ups are at the forefront of an emerging and promising sector of a global circular economy. Their blueprints and strategies for the future could be replicated across the world for the benefit of people and the planet.The World Economic Forum¡¦s UpLink platform provides an environment for entrepreneurs to present ideas that can drive the world towards meeting the U.N.¡¦s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.The merits of such a platform become clear when the U.N. points out that widespread seaweed cultivation is being hampered by a lack of global safety standards and a lack of collaboration in building the new ocean economy.',\n",
              " 'Global greenhouse gas emissions, even as they dropped last month to their lowest levels in more than a decade due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have fueled the ongoing climate crisis. Individuals and companies have long tried to reduce their emissions by what is known as carbon offsetting ¡X the practice of compensating for emissions by offsetting them in carbon storage projects. And in recent years, this trend is only accelerating.?But it begs the question: How can voluntary corporate carbon offset projects be responsibly implemented??We have seen a recent surge by some of the largest-emitting companies in using voluntary forest carbon offsets to compensate for emissions through the re-establishment of forests and improved forest management.Transactions in voluntary carbon markets hit a seven-year high in 2018, according to recent data from Forest Trends, with a market value of 295.7 million. The markets were propelled by increased interest in \"nature-based solutions\" for climate resilience, which drove a 264 percent increase in the volume of offsets generated through forestry and land use activities.?For example, Amazon committed 100 million to worldwide reforestation and peatlands protection efforts to count towards its goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2040. On Earth Day, it announced its first 10 million investment to restore and conserve forests in the northeastern U.S. in partnership with The Nature Conservancy. Microsoft said it would cultivate forest carbon offset projects in North and South America, including 60,000 acres in Brazil and 20,000 acres in New England. These projects may contribute to the company¡¦s goal to be \"carbon negative\" by 2030. In January, JetBlue announced its use of forest carbon offsets as part of its plan to become the first carbon-neutral U.S. airline. Shortly after, Nestle pledged to plant at least 3 million trees in Mexico and Brazil over the next 18 months to help achieve its carbon neutrality goal by 2050.So why are more companies committing to voluntary carbon offset projects??In part, this increased focus is no doubt in response to public concerns about climate change and climbing emissions. It¡¦s also clear that a growing number of institutional investors understand that protecting and creating healthy forests are essential actions for companies looking to meet their overall carbon emission reduction goals, since forests sequester carbon.Yet?not all of these carbon offset projects have received universal praise, suggesting that some of these commitments don¡¦t pass muster with investors and other stakeholders.?If not carefully designed, or part of a broader carbon management plan, carbon offset projects can have the potential to negatively affect local communities and economies, and biodiversity and other natural resources. That¡¦s why investors have become increasingly concerned over the potential reputational risks companies could face as they pursue well-intended efforts to tackle emissions. ?More investors are already focusing their engagements with companies on the financial implications of the reputational risks associated with commodity-driven deforestation.Last year, 251 investors with 17.7 trillion in assets under management called on companies to take urgent action on eliminating these risks, as well as operational and regulatory risks, in light of the devastating fires in the Amazon rainforest. Given this, Ceres aims to work with investors in the coming year to foster engagements with companies on forest carbon offset projects.With a focus on the important lessons learned through addressing deforestation risks and an eye towards emerging best practices, investors can begin to help companies design smarter carbon offset and forest management plans, and avoid reputational risks. They will encourage them to:1. Complement broader sector and company-wide efforts to reduce emissionsInvestors are increasingly engaging with companies on eliminating deforestation in their supply chains in a holistic way, as they see efforts to eliminate deforestation as a key component of an overall carbon management and emission-reduction plan. Investors will want to approach forest carbon offset projects in a similar way and to complement ¡X not replace ¡X company efforts to reduce emissions.If carbon offsetting isn¡¦t approached as just one part of a larger company strategy to abate emissions, the idea of offsetting emissions potentially could take company focus away from the primary need to meet emissions reduction goals, worsening the problem of company inaction on emissions reduction. It also could undermine investor confidence and public trust in forest carbon offsetting in the long-term.In order to avoid such reputational risks, companies should disclose the extent to which they will rely on forest conservation and carbon offset commitments to meet their overall emissions reduction goals. ?2. Design projects in partnership with local communities?With deforestation, investors are also focused on the financial incentives companies can create for supply chain producers to help foster forest conservation. The most successful forest carbon offset projects also support and stimulate local economies and the livelihoods of those in the community. This is especially important for companies working with indigenous and other under-resourced communities.?In Uganda, there were reports that an afforestation project, which creates a forest on previously unforested land, triggered community violence and diminished villagers\\' access to natural resources. The lesson learned here is that forest carbon offset projects need to be appropriately sited in partnership with the local community, and the associated risks must be effectively managed to avoid such issues.?3. Cultivate prosperous natural resource systems?Investors engaged with companies on eliminating deforestation risks are interested in not only securing long-term profits and protecting forests but also in cultivating prosperous natural resource systems.?Biodiversity is a key topic of deforestation-related engagements with companies. Investors increasingly recognize that biodiversity is key to maintaining resilience in human and natural ecosystems.Tropical forests are biodiversity hotspots ¡X as Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship for the Americas with BNP Paribas Asset Management, notes: \"There are many important opportunities to bring biodiversity into existing company conversations on forests and climate. Rather than shy away from \\'net-zero\\' emissions commitments, for example, we should be using these commitments to drive restoration of critical habitats, now.\"?Forests also perform vital ecosystem services, such as recycling water. Therefore, when assessing large-scale forest carbon offset projects companies also should factor in regional environmental impacts, such as the availability of water and existing native vegetation.4. Commit to using reputable verification standardsNot only do investors want to see companies make specific commitments to eliminate deforestation risks, they also want to see companies disclose measurable, verifiable progress on those commitments and seek third party verification of this progress.?Similarly, investors will want to know that companies embarking on forest carbon offset projects are committed to using credible monitoring and verification standards such as Gold Standard and the Verified Carbon Standard to assess and manage forest carbon offset projects.Companies should build monitoring mechanisms into their carbon offset and forest management plans to ensure projects continue to operate at peak performance. Investors will come to expect regular, standardized and verifiable corporate disclosures.No doubt, there will be a lot of challenges to navigate in the year ahead, as investors work with companies to implement smarter carbon offset and forest management plans.But by learning from the lessons of the past and sticking to these key principles, companies can achieve success in delivering on their emissions reduction goals, while restoring our forests and improving our local communities.',\n",
              " 'As the world nears its tipping points for climate change, biodiversity loss and natural resources depletion, sustainability takes on double the significance for food companies.The agri-food sector relies on increasingly scarce land, water and temperate climates, meaning the margins for becoming sustainable are narrowing, and this threatens the very bottom line of industry.But the sustainability of food producers, distributors and retailers also determines their social license to operate. Food companies may exist firstly for profit, but they are also responsible for nourishing an ever-growing population, more than half of which is overweight or obese.A recent analysis of sustainability strategies, Fixing the Business of Food, disclosed by the world¡¦s 100 largest food companies, lifts the lid on the existential threats that agri-food businesses are proactively countering, as well as those which industry has not yet internalized as sustainability risks and opportunities.With governments set to announce national strategies to radically change food systems at this month¡¦s UN Food Systems Summit, food companies must recognize and assume their role and responsibility as a key driver of this transformation.To ensure company sustainability strategies have maximum impact for both people and profit, food businesses should be asking four critical questions.1.Do our product portfolios and strategies contribute to healthy and sustainable diets?At present, only one in 10 of the largest food companies has set a comprehensive strategic objective in terms of contributing to healthy and sustainable diets. (The report did not specify which company.) As shown by the most authoritative nutrition literature, healthy and sustainable diets can reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity, and help extend the longevity and health span of their consumers.2. Are our production processes environmentally sustainable, or are they implicated in environmental harms such as greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater depletion and deforestation?By definition, over-exploiting the very resources necessary to your business is unsustainable, yet responsibility for environmental sustainability across food companies is patchy and inconsistent.Although more than 90 percent of companies monitor their greenhouse gas emissions, only around a fifth make it a specific objective to bring them down as part of their sustainability strategies.And despite recent high-profile campaigns around the environmental cost of palm oil, only six of the world¡¦s 100 largest companies make a point of recording sustainable sourcing.3. Do our upstream and downstream chains reflect our values by rejecting child and slave labor, and protecting the rights of workers, their families and communities?For food systems to become more inclusive and sustainable, companies must reduce not only their environmental impact but also the inequalities that mean millions working in agriculture globally are also among the poorest in the world.The sustainability of the agri-food sector relies as much on providing decent livelihoods and rights for everyone along the value chain as it does on protecting natural resources, and this includes indigenous and rural communities.Only 5 percent of the companies reviewed by the initiative published targets for sustainable supply chain management while none of them disclosed information regarding the protection of land and water rights.4. Do we fulfill our \"social license to produce\" by being honest, eschewing fraudulent practices, respecting all stakeholders and obeying the law?Strategic objectives and targets on meeting corporate tax obligations and protecting resource rights are typically missing from sustainability strategies, and this can undermine legitimate democratic institutions and public confidence.The greatest risk associated with a lack of accountability on issues such as corruption and legality is that this restricts governments¡¦ ability to finance and achieve the UN¡¦s Sustainable Development Goals to end hunger, poverty and climate change.Food companies alone cannot solve the world¡¦s challenges. And the UN Food Systems Summit is just the starting gun for an urgently needed transition by all sectors and elements of society.But it is in everyone¡¦s interests, including food businesses themselves, to play their role as fully as possible to contribute to the sustainability of people and planet, as well as profit.',\n",
              " 'Solving the plastic crisis is urgent. An estimated 11 million metric tons of plastic enter our oceans each year. That¡¦s a garbage truck and a half of plastic every minute of every day. If we delay dramatic action by just five years, an additional 80 million metric tons of plastic will end up in the ocean by 2040 (250 Empire State Buildings worth of trash). Without action, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish, by weight.That won¡¦t just mean more beached whales with stomachs full of plastic bags; the human consequences will be extreme, too. Healthy ocean ecosystems absorb CO2. A dead ocean has dire consequences for the climate. Plastic already has been found in the air, in the rain, in our bodies and in our food supply.That¡¦s why, in March, the Ocean Plastics Leadership Network, together with WWF and Greenpeace, led the first of four dialogue sessions. One hundred and forty organizations from 34 countries representing all the main stakeholders attended the two-day virtual event. The aim was to deepen understanding and build capacity for a Global Plastics Treaty.?With industry, government, activists and waste pickers given a seat at the table and an opportunity for constructive discussion, we were able to learn quite a bit.?While support for a global plastics treaty is growing, the window to make sure it happens is closing. In eight short months the United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA) will decide whether to start negotiations on such a treaty at UNEA 5.2 in Nairobi. It¡¦s essential that work begins on a treaty that is ambitious enough to match the scale and urgency of the problem, and that it¡¦s agreed upon in record time.The good news is that recent events indicate that approval for moving ahead with a plastics treaty is likely. One hundred countries already have declared their support. Russia came out in favor of a treaty in February. Australia signaled its support in March. The United States has not yet come out in support of a global treaty, but nearly 1 million Americans have joined the call for a treaty and the Biden administration is reviewing the issue.?Even more remarkable ¡X and hopeful ¡X is that a number of stakeholders who traditionally have been on opposing sides of various environmental debates agree that a formal treaty to counter widespread plastic pollution is necessary.?The first step in the process is for governments to agree on a mandate for negotiation. Questions such as, \"Will the treaty be voluntary or binding?\" and \"Will the treaty address the full life cycle of plastics or marine pollution only?\" are the first big decisions that need to be made. While there is significant agreement on many components of the treaty, such as harmonization of standards, a unified global reporting structure, environmental monitoring and the structure of the treaty, potential sticking points will need to be addressed.?There is potential for many requirements, standards, obligations, restrictions and even bans. Virgin reduction caps are also being discussed. NGOs are largely aligned on goals and scope, but many are still developing their thinking on the best mechanisms to get there. Industry perspectives are more diverse, as companies have different interests and concerns based on where they sit in the plastic supply chain.Government efforts, led by the Nordic states and a coalition among Germany, Ghana, Ecuador and Vietnam, are following traditional U.N. Treaty protocol to discuss the key questions mentioned above.?While the U.N. is deep in these discussions, we¡¦ve already seen significant progress from both industry and environmental groups. For example, environmental groups have continued to push aggressive Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) bills both here in the U.S. and abroad. Nine statehouses are in negotiations to be the first state in the U.S. to pass such legislation. Additionally, environmental groups continue to advance reuse and refill models that they believe are essential to shift the culture away from a reliance on single use plastics.Interested in learning more about the Accelerating a Global Plastics Treaty? Register for Circularity 21, where Dave Ford will be part of a panel with Greenpeace, WWF and Nestl? focused on this question: Why do we need a global treaty for plastics and what is the business case for advancing one?Companies have been active, too. Walmart, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Unilever, P&G, and many other major consumer packaged goods companies have announced goals to reduce their use of virgin plastic. While the scale of these initiatives doesn¡¦t always match the size of the problem yet, tackling source reduction aligns with what many activists want included in a global treaty.?Finally, WWF launched ReSource: Plastic, a first-of-its-kind supply chain transparency initiative, last year. For the kickoff, five of the world¡¦s biggest companies agreed to make their supply chain transparent. Initiatives such as this can demonstrate successful programs the U.N. could scale up to achieve global goals. ?In organizing the Global Plastics Treaty Dialogues, we¡¦ve seen so much good will from governments all over the world. But to truly solve the ocean plastics crisis, we¡¦ll need more than good intentions. We¡¦ll need a solution framework rooted in science alongside the U.N. process.?Pew and SYSTEMIQ¡¦s Breaking the Plastic Wave report, published in 2020, presents just such a framework designed to reduce plastic in the oceans by 80 percent in the next 20 years. Environmental NGOs and industry might not agree with every one of the report¡¦s eight points? ¡X reduce, substitute, design, scale up collection, double mechanical recycling, develop plastic-to-plastic conversion, dispose?and reduce waste imports ¡X but its approach offers a clear foundation for solving the issue.?For business leaders looking to get up to speed on the Global Plastics Treaty, we recommend studying the following three reports from environmental groups, industry?and government to get a balanced view from different key stakeholder groups.Environmental NGO groups voiced their support for a plastics treaty in a report from the Center for International Environmental Law, the Environment Investigation Agency, GAIA and Break Free From Plastic. On the government side, the Nordic Council of Ministers rolled out a 148-page report that provides a suggested framework for a future treaty. WWF, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and Boston Consulting Group laid out the business case for a global treaty, and 30 major companies have signed onto a \"Business Call for a U.N. Treaty On Plastic Pollution,\" urging others to join them in advocating for an international response that aligns businesses and governments and offers a clear approach to addressing the plastic crisis.?Additionally, the Ocean Plastics Leadership Network, together with WWF and Greenpeace, will host the second of four Global Treaty Dialogues in our series July 28-29 in both hemispheres. We¡¦re in the process of expanding these sessions and welcome the participation of all stakeholders in the ocean plastics crisis. More information can be found here.?We believe that tension equals progress, and that through these sessions stakeholders just might discover they are more closely aligned than they previously thought. It¡¦s important that we spend the precious months before UNEA 5.2 fighting the battles that need to be fought, and not wasting time where there is already agreement. Join us. We don¡¦t have time to lose.',\n",
              " 'It¡¦s hard to make planting trees political, one reason this climate mitigation strategy has received rare bipartisan support for the past two decades. Corporations have used that to their advantage to become an important part of the tree planting business. Funding tree planting in rural areas across the globe was an easy way for businesses to invest in green initiatives and to win points with the general public.?But urban forestry has a different history. The canopy of trees in cities often corresponds to maps of redlining, income and race. That¡¦s one reason investing in urban forestry isn¡¦t as simple; nor does it have the same sustainability impacts. Regardless of those challenges, more businesses are deciding to put their money behind forestry projects in cities.In 2013, American Forests called Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and New York; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Seattle and Washington, D.C., the 10 best cities for urban forestry. In a 2016 study, Seattle determined 28 percent of the city is covered in trees, close to its 2037 goal of 30 percent. D.C. hopes to cover 40 percent of its district with canopy by 2032.?That has attracted the attention of companies. Amazon, for example, recently announced a 4.37 million commitment to The Nature Conservancy to support an initiative in Berlin. And for the past few years, Bank of America has partnered with American Forests on the Community ReLeaf Program, planting nearly 3,000 trees in 19 cities. One impressive goal for this partnership is to bring 200,000 trees to Detroit. As Microsoft builds data centers in Iowa, it is also investing in urban forestry projects to bring an environmental and health benefit to the neighborhood as well. A project that planted 734 trees created total savings of 56,693 per year through energy savings, air quality and rain interception for the city.?Here are four things sustainability teams should know when considering the urban tree business.Because urban forestry generally has a relatively low carbon removal impact,?fewer organizations are focused on creating carbon credits for these projects. According to McPherson, City Forest Credits thinks of itself as a LEED system for urban forestry. It connects businesses with urban forestry projects and then issues a certified carbon credit.?But because urban forestry has so many ancillary benefits not included in the carbon credit, McPherson¡¦s company also issues a bundled credit that includes the health benefits of urban trees and it is working on an impact scorecard.City Forest Credits worked with scientists to quantify the exact health benefits of each tree, creating a measurement scheme similar to carbon removal metrics.\"We can assess a project\\'s equity and health impacts, and then we¡¦ve mapped those impacts to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,\" he said.?But as is the case with renewable energy credits, there are worries that carbon credits could give businesses the same license-to-pollute mentality. McPherson sees it differently.?\"Trees are like going on the offense,\" he said. \"They¡¦re not just playing defense against climate, they are actually pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. That¡¦s real.\"For many years, urban forestry projects were unattractive to corporations because you couldn¡¦t plant enough trees in an urban environment to achieve a meaningful carbon dioxide removal impact. Carbon removal was seen as the only benefit of trees and the only way corporations could quantify a project¡¦s impact.?But urban forests have myriad other benefits that are becoming more understood and easier to measure: They have been demonstrated to help control stormwater, lower energy costs, improve air quality and provide both physical and mental health benefits. And if placed intentionally in the most needed areas, trees can have a profound effect in addressing environmental justice concerns.In Richmond, Virginia, for example, a 65-acre African-American forested cemetery was struggling economically, and the owner considered logging the trees to keep it as a pillar in the community. Instead, the organization opted for an urban forestry project with City Forest Credits that conserved the trees and created earnings for the cemetery by generating 5,376 carbon credits to sell.As a result, the trees continued to be an environmental asset to the community, important African-American history was conserved and the credits could benefit other corporations on their environmental goals. A threefold impact.\"There¡¦s a strong desire to have projects that benefit people,\" said Mark McPherson, founder of City Forest Credits. \"And the urban forest is obviously where people live and breathe and recreate.\"Sustainability experts might be familiar with the dollar-per-tree model, but that isn¡¦t true of urban forestry. The different cost structures for a city tree can come as a surprise to corporations. Urban land is expensive. The installation of mature trees is expensive. Maintaining trees is expensive.?Unlike wild forests where a planter can spread out a hundred seedlings easily and walk away, urban forestry requires more labor, planning and permits.?\"We plant much more mature trees in cities,\" said Jad Daley, CEO of American Forests. \"So they have a greater likelihood of surviving and so we can get the benefits more quickly, but that also makes them more expensive.\"Corporations may opt to create a diverse portfolio of forestry projects, doing large landscape projects in rural areas for sequestering carbon and then supporting a few urban forestry projects for immediate contribution to the neighborhood.Working with an NGO is a great way to contribute to an urban forestry project. But Lynn Scarlett, head of the external affairs division for The Nature Conservancy, working with Amazon on the Berlin project, stressed that companies shouldn¡¦t treat NGOs as consultants.?\"It¡¦s a collaborative partnership between an NGO and a company,\" Scarlett said. \"We have our goals, and those are always front and center stage for us. Always. We look at partnerships that advance our mission.\"Scarlett said companies usually team with The Nature Conservancy when they¡¦ve determined that there are shared goals but they don¡¦t necessarily have the full knowledge to execute them.?So while an NGO can help steer a company in the right direction, its goals might not overlap 100 percent with those of a company seeking to work on urban forestry. NGOs can act as the link between the money, the mission, the regulatory agencies and the population.?\"NGOs can help bring together all stakeholders required,\" said Kerstin Pfliegner, Germany director at The Nature Conservancy. \"We can work well with governments and?corporates while being close to civil society and communities.\"',\n",
              " 'For Gershon Grossman and Ed Murray, 1978 was a big year. Grossman, then a solar energy pioneer at the Technion, Israel¡¦s premier technological institute, was launching the first International Conference on the Application of Solar Energy. Murray, an idealist attending college, joined an upstart solar heating company in Sacramento, California¡¦s capital, drawn by a prescient concern about climate change and, as he puts it, an impulse to \"save the world.\"For both, the excitement was palpable. Solar water heaters were surging into the market, solar thermal energy showed broad potential, and the two were riding the wave.Four decades later, however, they live in two different worlds. In Israel, 85 percent of households get hot water from a dud shemesh, or \"sun boiler.\" But in the U.S., despite decades of advocacy by Murray and others, the number of households that have a solar water heater is less than 1 percent. In California, many people don¡¦t even know the technology exists.America¡¦s solar water heating deficit is often portrayed as a historical accident driven by the vagaries of politics and comparatively cheap fossil fuels. However, interviews with academic and commercial players on the front lines of the solar thermal industry, and a recent in-depth report on the now-expired California Solar Initiative¡VThermal (CSI-T) program, suggest that the desire for simple, \"magic bullet\" solutions to climate change also has played a significant role in relegating this practical technology to the sidelines.Heating water accounts for 25 percent of residential energy use worldwide, mostly achieved by burning fossil fuels. Solar water heaters do the job without combustion. Unlike solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which convert sunlight into electricity, solar thermal systems collect solar energy as heat.?Solar water heaters transfer this heat to water in a holding tank. Other energy sources, such as natural gas or electricity from a power grid, serve as a backup for cloudy days.By tapping the sun, solar water heaters can reduce a household¡¦s water heating fuel consumption 50 percent to 70 percent. Israel is just one of dozens of countries with a variety of climates where this technology has been deployed. Solid performance and wide applicability have made the technology one of Project Drawdown¡¦s top 50 climate change solutions.So why did solar thermal technology soar in Israel and sputter in California, setting Grossman and Murray on such different life paths? A pair of political decisions in the 1970s and 1980s had dramatic impact.The Yom Kippur War of 1973 and subsequent oil embargo made energy independence a matter of national security worldwide, but the pinch was particularly painful in countries lacking oil production. For Israel, the threat was existential; as former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir famously quipped, \"Moses took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil.\" In 1976, Israel mandated solar water heaters for all new residential buildings up to eight stories tall ¡X a mandate extended to all residential buildings last December.For Grossman, now a professor emeritus at the Technion and head of the Energy Forum at the Neaman Institute for National Policy Research, mandating solar water heaters made sense environmentally, even beyond Israel¡¦s political agenda. \"You just can¡¦t argue with the numbers on how much?energy you can save using solar water heating instead of electrical heating.\"The U.S. also felt the jolt of the oil embargo and feared running out of domestic oil. Supported by President Jimmy Carter¡¦s 1978 federal tax credits for renewable energy, Americans installed nearly 1 million solar thermal systems by 1990, supplied by more than 200 U.S. manufacturers, including leading corporations such as Grumman Aerospace Corporation and Sears Roebuck.?Renewable solar heats 85 percent of households in Israel, who get hot water from a dud shemesh, or \"sun boiler.\" In the U.S., it¡¦s a different story. Photo courtesy of Yaniv Hassidof.However, in contrast to Israel, America¡¦s commitment to renewable energy proved ephemeral. Under President Ronald Reagan, the federal incentives lapsed, dealing the solar thermal industry a body-blow. \"We went from 650 companies in California that were installing solar water heaters to about 37 overnight,\" recalls Murray, currently president and CEO of two California companies dedicated to manufacturing, distributing and installing solar thermal systems, as well as president of the California Solar and Storage Association.Recent attempts to revive the residential solar water heater industry have had limited success. The CSI-T program, begun in 2010 as a larger push to incentivize solar installations statewide, aimed to add 200,000 systems, but received only 6,237 applications for residential retrofits in 10 years, according to the program¡¦s December report. \"I could put a sign over the front door of my office that says ¡¥free solar water heating,¡¦ and they¡¦d probably still stay away in droves,\" Murray says with a wry laugh.Larger installations for apartment complexes, hotels and universities and home pool heating have helped keep Murray¡¦s solar thermal businesses afloat despite the lack of other residential demand. Ironically, the commercial sector isn¡¦t as robust in Israel because the country¡¦s original mandate only applied to residential properties ¡X a move Grossman views as a significant oversight. Indeed, Grossman believes that an industrial mandate could increase Israel¡¦s renewables usage up to fivefold.The woes of the American solar water heater industry go far beyond politics, however. The industry also suffers a more insidious challenge: For the average consumer, \"going solar\" means just one thing: solar PV.?Solar thermal technologies, including solar water heating, provide a direct, thermodynamically efficient and cost-effective method for decarbonizing heating. And for households in mild climates with low electricity bills, \"solar water heating can be one of the simplest ways ¡K to use renewable energy and save on energy bills,\" says the CSI-T report.But solar PV has exploded into the global electricity sector, thanks to manufacturing innovations and strong government support. Leveraging economies of scale, the price of solar PV panels has dropped by over an order of magnitude in the past decade. In California, additional boosts came from government-instituted solar feed-in tariffs, cheap financing plans and private-sector investments. And, in a major coup for the industry, California mandated solar PV on new residences up to three stories starting 2020.On the other hand, California¡¦s residential solar water heater industry finds itself in a vicious cycle of low consumer demand and high prices. As the CSI-T report notes, \"In contrast to conventional gas and electric water heaters, which are typically installed by plumbers, solar water heaters are installed by a range of firms and public entities.\" In other words, consumers actively must seek out solar water heaters by relying on nonstandard sales channels.This additional friction reduces consumer demand among all but the most motivated consumers, leading to higher marketing costs that drive up the customer¡¦s bottom line. Prices in California are further exacerbated by past industry failures, which have led to strong, self-imposed regulations in the name of consumer satisfaction, says Murray. For example, after many cheaper solar water heating systems froze during the unprecedented 1990 freeze in California, only more expensive systems were allowed through the CSI-T program.All told, the cost of the average solar water heater sold in California through the CSI-T program was 7,400, compared to less than 1,000 for a fossil fuel alternative. By contrast, a solar water heater in Israel can cost as little as 700.Today, drumming up excitement for solar thermal remains difficult. According to CSI-T report interviews with solar water heater adopters, \"Some interviewees remarked that it seemed tough to get others interested, theorizing that PV was so dominant in neighbors¡¦ minds that solar water heating hardly registered.\"\"It¡¦s just the sizzling, sexy PV that really captivates the audience,\" says Murray.Entrepreneurs routinely caution, \"Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.\" In this case, the problem is carbon emissions, and, against entrepreneurial advice, individual governments have tended to fall in love with just one solution. For Israel, Cyprus, Hawaii and others, solar water heaters were that solution. For California, it¡¦s solar PV.By committing to a specific technology, governments fall prey to a conceptual error that science journalist Ed Yong recently referred to as a \"monogamy of solutions.\" (Interestingly, he argues this fallacy also shapes the government¡¦s response to COVID-19.) Rather than embracing the growing portfolio of technologies available to solve the carbon emissions problem, going all-in on one satisfies the very human need for \"magic bullets.\"Europe¡¦s Green Deal may model such a \"portfolio\" approach for the rest of the world, according to B?rbel Epp, a German physicist-turned-journalist with nearly two decades of experience studying the global solar thermal market.According to Epp, representatives from the European solar thermal market have lobbied the European Commission for over a decade to use solar thermal technologies to decarbonize the heating sector. \"It took the solar thermal industry I don¡¦t know how many years, at least 10, of just continuously repeating the sentence that heat is 50 percent of our final energy consumption in Europe. ¡K It was hard to lobby in Europe, but it¡¦s now obvious that we have to do something for heat.\" Whether these efforts will succeed in providing solar thermal a seat at the table remains to be seen.To Grossman, solar water heaters are the first piece of Israel¡¦s portfolio. As Israel struggles to meet its Paris Agreement goals, Grossman says he believes solar PV panels will take their place alongside solar water heaters on Israel¡¦s rooftops.Back in Sacramento, Murray is still battling for solar thermal. This year, he¡¦s lobbied the California legislature to extend the state¡¦s recently expired solar thermal subsidy program for one more year, citing COVID-19 as a barrier. The legislature hasn¡¦t budged, but Murray vows he¡¦ll keep going. He may be a lot older than he was in 1978, but the idealism is still alive.Editor¡¦s note: Dina Berenbaum and Manoshi Datta wrote this story as participants in the?Ensia Mentor Program. ',\n",
              " 'A new report by The Conference Board reveals the latest trends in sustainability reporting. The analysis examined how nearly 6,000 companies in 26 countries are reporting on more than 90 environmental and social practices, ranging from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to boardroom diversity to water consumption.As companies prepare for the sustainability reporting season, here are four takeaways.Across the global sample, nearly one-quarter (23 percent) of companies report their GHG emissions. That¡¦s up from 21 percent last year. And in the U.S. sample (made up of the 250 largest companies by revenue), 56 percent of companies report GHG emissions. Last year, 49 percent of U.S. companies in the sample reported this data.Climate risk disclosure is also on the upswing: Across the global sample, 9 percent of companies report climate-related risks, up from 6 percent last year. Almost half of U.S. companies examined (47 percent) disclose climate risk, a significant increase from 36 percent last year.The analysis also found increases in disclosure of water consumption: One in five companies in the global sample report how much water they consume, up from 18 percent last year. Such disclosure is also up in the United States, as more than one-third (34 percent) of companies in the sample report this data, compared to 29 percent last year.What¡¦s fueling the disclosure momentum?In the U.S., for example, the two largest public pension funds ¡X the California Public Employees¡¦ Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers¡¦ Retirement System (CalSTRS) ¡X are required by California law to report the climate-related financial risks of their portfolios as of the beginning of this year.There is also the fact that sustainability disclosure requirements in Europe are influencing the reporting practices of companies in other jurisdictions, including U.S. companies. The recent implementation of the European Union¡¦s nonfinancial reporting directive, for example, is resulting in increased disclosure by both European and foreign companies operating in Europe, as the latter are also subject to the requirements.While disclosure is generally on the rise, this greater transparency does not always produce significant changes in practice ¡X at least not yet. This disconnect highlights the fact that disclosure does not necessarily drive performance ¡X at least not immediately. It may also reflect that many companies may be responding to reporting requests but have not yet made sustainability an integral part of their business strategy.??For example, GHG reporting by companies in the S&P Global 1200 index has increased over the last three years, from 45 percent of companies reporting on these emissions three years ago to 61 percent this year. However, the median emissions of companies in this index also has risen over the last three years, from 591,000 metric tons to 786,000 metric tons of GHGs. Even when measured by revenue intensity (GHG emissions per revenue), median emissions are back up to the levels recorded three years ago after a slight dip in the last two years.The trend is similar for water consumption: Half of S&P Global 1200 companies report this information, up from 37 percent two years ago. The median volume of water consumed by these companies also has increased, from 4.4 million three years ago to 5.2 million most recently. As with GHG emissions, water consumption also has increased over the last three years when measured by revenue intensity.? ??As more companies report nonfinancial data, there is greater demand from investors for reliable, high-quality and comparable data. External assurance is one way to help provide some confidence. In a recent survey by McKinsey, virtually all investors surveyed agreed that sustainability reports should undergo some audit.The Conference Board¡¦s analysis found that, across the global sample, 17 percent of companies opt to have some of their sustainability information externally assured. In the U.S. sample, one-third of companies undergo assurance for sustainability data, up from 28 percent last year. While assurance is becoming more common, there is still much variation in this practice, with notable differences both in the levels obtained by companies and the types of organizations providing the assurance. 70 percent of survey respondents believe the need for sustainability assurance will increase over the next five years. Responses to our recent survey on sustainability assurance indicate that most companies obtain only \"limited assurance\" for their sustainability information, typically related to GHG emissions, energy consumption and water consumption. Few companies obtain assurance for their full sustainability report.Sustainability assurance is not perfect, but it likely will become more important: 70 percent of survey respondents believe the need for assurance will increase over the next five years. Notably, almost 90 percent of respondents currently obtaining assurance for their sustainability data believe there would be implications if they discontinued the practice. The most significant potential consequences they mentioned include diminished credibility, pushback from investors and other stakeholders, and reduced scores from ratings agencies.Transparency is a good thing, and we can celebrate the increased attention by corporations to sustainability disclosure. At the same time, we should not focus too narrowly on disclosure. There is a real possibility that the requirements of various reporting frameworks and rating agencies may push companies ¡X many of which have noted \"reporting fatigue\" ¡X to prioritize responding to reporting requests over addressing the underlying sustainability challenges and opportunities that a particular company faces. Indeed, the sheer size of the ever-changing sustainability reporting arena (which only grew with the addition of the World Economic Forum¡¦s draft framework (PDF)) can itself compromise energy and attention.Companies face a daunting challenge in this environment: being mindful of the expectations for increased and standardized ESG disclosure, while at the same time focusing their sustainability efforts on the issues that are most material to their business and telling their story authentically and effectively to multiple constituencies.?Achieving that balance will require a coordinated ¡X and sustained ¡X effort across the C-suite but should yield long-term returns for stockholders and other stakeholders alike.',\n",
              " 'When I cover solutions to the plastic waste crisis, I typically focus on infrastructure development and bringing recycling systems to scale, standardizing materials, inventing new ones and designing out unnecessary single-use items, and rethinking business models and supply chains.But once these structures are in place, they only work if consumers embrace new models and ensure that materials move through the system as planned. Otherwise, the entire system breaks down.And if you thought it was hard getting your colleagues to recycle rigid plastic or compost paper towels, or to stop wishcycling ¡X that whatever they throw into the bin will, in fact, be recycled ¡X think about the complexity of changing consumer behavior across a city, country or beyond.?During a recent webcast, I had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Natalie Hallinger, a behavioral scientist and behavior change adviser working to translate research on human motivation into real-world behavior change strategies.?Here are four tips Hallinger recommends for designing large-scale interventions:?I invite you to listen to the entire webcast here, which includes additional insights on behavior change from Jacob Duer, president and CEO of Alliance to End Plastic Waste; Jeff Kirschner, founder and CEO of Litterati; and John Warner, distinguished research fellow at Zymergen.',\n",
              " 'The movement to achieve net-zero global greenhouse gas emissions is gaining traction and coherence, especially in the world of finance. In late March, BlackRock and Vanguard ¡X the two largest asset managers on the planet ¡X joined a growing coalition of investors in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM). The initiative outlines key requirements for signatories¡¦ commitments to net zero and provides an early benchmark for the industry. Earlier in March, asset managers also received initial guidance for implementing net-zero commitments with the release of the Net Zero Investment Framework Implementation Guide, an effort led by the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change.These emerging industry coalitions, and their growing support among asset managers, are critical. To avoid the worst impacts of global warming, we need every financial organization to have robust, credible plans for shifting investment portfolios toward net-zero by 2050 or sooner.But, as NZAM itself notes, there is still ambiguity about what a credible, robust and science-based net-zero investment portfolio actually looks like. It is not surprising, therefore, that financial institution net-zero commitments still leave many unanswered questions around key issues such as definitions, interim targets, use of offsets and transparency. This includes those from BlackRock and Vanguard.Given their size, BlackRock and Vanguard have tremendous market influence. Together, they manage over 15.2 trillion in assets, an amount equivalent to about three-fifths of U.S. GDP. This gives them the capacity to set the course for meaningful net-zero action within the asset management sector. It¡¦s critical that their next steps demonstrate their seriousness and urgency in implementing their net zero commitment.',\n",
              " 'Companies often struggle with building community trust as they navigate between profit-making and authentically engaging on climate change and environmental justice matters.Last week at GreenBiz Group¡¦s virtual conference and expo on stimulating the clean economy, VERGE 20, community leaders and businesses from across the country came together to network, share insights and explore solutions to these challenges. During the panel \"Connecting Communities to the Clean Economy,\" experts shared their experiences working with private companies, their fights for green jobs and why businesses need to think of themselves as part of the community. The talk featured two women of color and leaders within the environmental and economic justice movement: Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE (founded as the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park); and Rahwa Ghirmatzion, executive director of PUSH Buffalo (People United for Sustainable Housing); with Heather Clancy, editorial director at GreenBiz, acting as moderator.PUSH Buffalo is a nonprofit grassroots community organization working to build and execute a comprehensive revitalization plan for West Buffalo¡¦s West Side. This stimulus plan includes affordable housing rehabilitation, building weatherization and other green infrastructure projects. UPROSE is Brooklyn\\'s foremost Latinx community organization. Its work involves community organizing, supporting sustainable development and community-led climate adaptation in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Panelists explained how their community organizations and business partners have successfully collaborated in the past. The conversation provided an insight into how companies can understand the communities they serve, the area they¡¦re in and the people they employ. Communicating genuinely and authentically listening are two key components. Here are four key takeaways:1. To build real, authentic community trust, businesses must be willing to listen to community concerns and respond with effective community-oriented solutions. Ghirmatzion talked about PUSH Buffalo¡¦s work with a local hiring hall that connects New Yorkers to jobs. This initiative provides both hands-on training for people in the Buffalo area who have been underemployed for long periods of time and employment opportunities in renewable energy projects and green construction. According to Rahwa, at least \"99.9 percent of them were folks of color.\" For example, a few years ago, about 24 of PUSH¡¦s trainees experienced racist harassment and open hostility from their white coworkers and supervisor. When PUSH brought their concerns to the company¡¦s CEO, the organization investigated the matter and fired the supervisor. Workers and community members alike appreciated the company¡¦s quick action and zero tolerance, Ghirmatzion said. Listening to the community and taking their issues seriously is crucial for building trust, she observed.2. Private entities should think of themselves as community members and view local residents as political and economic partners.For Yeampierre of UPROSE, the most successful partnerships have been ones in which businesses joined local initiatives and shared the same political and environmental goals as the community. According to Yeampierre, UPROSE has had excellent relationships with some companies and terrible relationships with others. The excellent relationships have been with businesses that seek input from UPROSE on climate adaptation and embrace UPROSE¡¦s best practices for environmental justice and community resiliency. Yeampierre cited two successful partnerships. Sims Recycling Solutions worked with UPROSE from the beginning to become a carbon-neutral state-of-the-art facility that would serve community needs but not be an eyesore or polluting facility on the industrial waterfront. Additionally, UPROSE has received support from Patagonia since 2011. In this mutually beneficial relationship, Patagonia also provides financial support for UPROSE¡¦s environmental work. UPROSE has helped Patagonia have an office culture in which its employees join in UPROSE¡¦s grass-roots organizing. As Yeampierre said, \"Sometimes businesses don\\'t see themselves as part of the community, and see our community as a front for wealth for them.\" She encouraged private businesses to view the community they operate in not as a resource but as a partner. 3. Businesses and developers need to embrace resilient thinking rather than viewing job creation and profit-making as their key goals.Yeampierre got a chance to provide a brief overview of UPROSE¡¦s work to protect Sunset Park¡¦s industrial waterfront from land speculation. UPROSE was at the center of a triumphant seven-year-long struggle against the rezoning of Industry City in Brooklyn. However, the rezoning would have created thousands of jobs. Developers viewed this project as a win-win, but activists and community leaders opposed it because the jobs would have been mostly low-paying. Plus, the influx of high-end retail and new office jobs would spur gentrification. Yeampierre argued that waterfronts such as Sunset Park are where we need to start building for \"climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience.\" \"It\\'s what we call a green reindustrialization of our industrial waterfront,\" she added.Making a resilient New York means investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency retrofits, construction, sustainable manufacturing and food security, all of which would create thousands of jobs. We need these things now, because as Yeampierre said, \"We know that climate change is here.\" The campaign to preserve the waterfront was a significant victory for industrial communities all over the U.S., who are told they ought to accept new jobs that rely on the extraction of fossil fuels and displacement. Sunset Park¡¦s future could become a model for converting an industrial zone into an environmentally friendly infrastructure through green manufacturing.Businesses should avoid trying to fight long, drawn-out battles that ignore the wishes of the community. Instead, it¡¦s vital to support community-led proposals consistent with a resilient green future from the beginning. 4. Companies can use their communications resources to showcase community climate activists\\' voices and a voice in the fight for a just transition.Both UPROSE and PUSH Buffalo are a part of NY Renews, a coalition of over 140 community, labor and grassroots organizations working to end climate change in New York while safeguarding workers. Moderator Clancy asked how being members of this coalition amplifies their work. Both panelists agreed that the legislation NY Renews fights for, such as the Climate Mobilization Act, which passed last year, makes it easier for smaller social justice-based organizations to show their communities it¡¦s possible to have a just transition. This legislation would generate thousands of jobs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy prices. Companies also can benefit from supporting the work of NY Renews because a just transition is an idea that appeals to workers and communities who fear that the process of reducing emissions could lead to a future with fewer jobs and more poverty. For UPROSE, being in NY Renews \"helps us build locally, but it also helps us build the scale, and it helps us create the kind of regional impact that climate change demands. We need to be thinking big and locally,\" Yeampierre declared. Supporting or doing similar work as NY Renews, creating green and decent jobs, can help private enterprises show that they want to support resiliency and want communities to thrive.In their closing remarks, both panelists reiterated their earlier comments on authenticity and seeking community input as soon as they start planning a project. Authentic?was the word the panelists most used to describe the kind of relationship and behavior they would like to see from businesses. \"Authentic\" is the characteristic you should want the community to think of your company as, and you should meet that expectation, the tow community organizers observed. That is, authentic businesses genuinely communicate; they find out what their community wants and take the impact they have on the community seriously. People who live in the community can offer?many solutions and critical perspectives because they¡¦ve been working on these issues for generations, they concluded.',\n",
              " 'Since the anniversary of George Floyd¡¦s murder in May, I¡¦ve been thinking about what the food industry has done to improve racial equity over the past year.It¡¦s not an easy question to answer. Even harder is evaluating if what the companies have done is meaningful. Many have pledged to take action in the aftermath of Floyd¡¦s death, but pledges need to be followed by actual progress. So I looked into the 10 largest food manufacturers in North America to see what moves they have made.?I reached out to the U.S. branches of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, General Mills, JBS, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Nestl?, PepsiCo, Smithfield Foods and Tyson Foods, asking for information about the goals they set and the progress they made over the last year to improve the health and economic outcomes of Black communities.?Sorting through the information on company websites, sustainability reports and through my conversations, what I ended up with was a long list of pledges, partnerships and programs ¡X including donations, staff training, scholarship funds and supplier diversity programs, among other approaches.The first thing that stood out was the apparent lack of shared metrics and reporting frameworks to compare companies¡¦ ambition and progress. Because of the many disparate efforts and timelines the industry uses, it will be nearly impossible to assess whether the initiatives will add up to meaningful change. A shared public-private agenda for dismantling systemic racism in food manufacturing will be necessary.?Second, I noticed that some companies thought harder than others about the specific difference they can make. Systemic racism, like the climate crisis, is an enormous and complex challenge no company can be asked to solve on its own. But every company holds a vital piece of the puzzle. The ones who recognize this sweet spot, in addition to funding the work of critical racial justice organizations and supporting progressive policy, caught my attention the most. Let¡¦s take a closer look at some of the innovative approaches companies are using.Increasing the percentage of Black members in executive and management teams is essential to give visibility to Black employees in an organization and diversify culture and business strategy. So far, Coca-Cola has set the most ambitious and transparent goal, based on my research. The CPG company aims to align its employee population with U.S. census data across all team levels by 2030. For senior management, this means increasing Black leaders from 8 to 13 percent. This goal is notable because it¡¦s objective and guided by the country¡¦s actual demographic makeup rather than a decision that aligns primarily with business interests and constraints.?Other companies committed to expanding Black representation include PepsiCo, General Mills and Mars. PepsiCo is set to increase the proportion of Black managers from 8 percent in Q1 2021 to 10 percent by 2025. General Mills aims to double its Black managers. Mars has a less specific goal of increasing racial minority representation in management by 40 percent.?DEI practices aren¡¦t only about visibility and team culture ¡X finances matter, too. Nestl? is doing the most innovative work in this realm by linking executive pay and performance to DEI outcomes. This practice has been discussed for sustainability outcomes for years and is finally gaining momentum. But the corporation didn¡¦t disclose any details about this practice that could help assess the impact it might have, set an industry standard or encourage other companies to follow its example.?Nestl? and Coca-Cola are also working to close the race pay gap in addition to their work on pay equity between genders, an often overlooked but critical issue.For food companies, engaging suppliers on environmental issues is essential and becoming the norm. Suppliers should be just as involved when it comes to social impact. From what I could tell, Coca-Cola is taking the lead on supplier diversity programs. It plans to double its spending with Black-owned businesses over the next five years, reaching at least 500 million. PepsiCo follows suit with a pledge to spend 350 million by 2025. And Smithfield planned a 14 percent increase in purchases from minority-owned businesses by 2025, totaling 105 million. It also will provide 10 million over the next three years for financial and technical support to minority farmers.?While these commitments are significant, they lack transparency. How were the numbers chosen? What percentage of Coca-Cola¡¦s total spend is going to diverse suppliers? Compared to Coca-Cola¡¦s minority employment goals that are clearly aligned with objective statistics from the U.S. census, these numbers feel pulled from thin air. It would be more coherent to set the same objective goal across all DEI pillars.?Better access to quality education is key for more Black people to become innovative entrepreneurs, managers and corporate executives. As such, education is a foundational pillar for DEI progress, requiring adequate investment. Several companies are stepping up to provide scholarship and grant programs that create a more diverse talent pipeline for the food industry.?Smithfield committed 500,000 to students interested in food, agriculture and natural resource careers through scholarships, summer stipends and other programs at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Nestl? and Pepsi also have HBCU partnerships, and PepsiCo will invest 25 million in college scholarships, generally. Anheuser-Busch launched a 100,000 scholarship program to encourage Black students to pursue STEM careers, preparing them for jobs in the brewing industry. Mars offers scholarships of up to 25,000 per year to Black students interested in food industry careers. These initiatives are a start, but likely won¡¦t suffice to meet the increasing demand for diverse talent, similar to the shortage of sustainability professionals already unfolding.Not all companies have listened to the demands of advocates, protestors and their employees over the past year. While Tyson has donated 5 million to the cause and told me it integrates DEI practices \"in all aspects of the workplace,\" it hasn¡¦t backed its commitment with quantified goals. Kraft Heinz doesn¡¦t have any programs focused on racial equity to date. Yet a spokesperson told me the company is planning to include the issue in its upcoming ESG report at the end of July.?JBS USA, a subsidiary of the Brazilian meat processing giant, is the only one of the 10 companies for which I could find no evidence of work on this issue. It declined to comment and does not talk about racial justice issues in corporate communications, despite just having settled a 10-year lawsuit over racial and religious discrimination in its meatpacking plants with a 5.5 million pay to employees.',\n",
              " 'Reading about Sony¡¦s 2001 \"Cadmium Crisis\" in Daniel Esty¡¦s \"Green to Gold\" book was my first introduction to the financial gravity of environmental noncompliance.?This incident had cost the company 130 million, which all began as a result of its inadequate supply chain policies. This illustrated the importance of having sustainability integrated into supply chains ¡X and not as an afterthought.?Understanding this context was important and had me questioning how much has really changed in the last 19 years. As such, I was thrilled to attend GreenBiz 20, where I had the opportunity to sit in on the Supply Chain Transparency Summit. Both the summit and the conference were incredibly useful in providing a broader context of current best practices as well as a place to learn about the challenges many companies are facing as they embark on greening their supply chains.The first thing that became immensely clear was the staggering number of companies that are all increasingly concerned by their supply chain emissions. This is no surprise given the 2019 CDP report (PDF) which found that companies¡¦ supply chains create, on average, 5.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as their own operations. Accordingly, as businesses begin to more fully realize the breadth of their supply chain emissions, they are adopting strong supply chain emission reduction targets.?These goals often target material sourcing and procurement policies. For example, handbag maker The Sak recently committed to improve the sustainability of its production and sourcing, including a 2023 goal for 100 percent recycled lining materials in its bags. Elsewhere, spice giant McCormick set a 2025 goal for 100 percent circular plastic packaging. These commitments represent a tremendous opportunity for sustainability managers to adopt and implement cutting-edge policies for sustainable sourcing and materials.In understanding emission reduction goals, it¡¦s helpful to use the GHG Protocol framework (PDF), which defines the three main \"scopes.\" Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy and Scope 3 covers all other indirect emissions that occur in the company¡¦s value chain.?So how should companies tackle their Scope 3 emissions? Below are some ideas to help companies evolve and build their sustainable supply chain strategy.?\\nWhen it comes to greening supply chains, many tools are available for companies embarking on this journey.?The first and most important resource available is industry peers. At GreenBiz 20, many companies shared their commitments around supply chain emissions reductions as well as insights for how those initiatives are proceeding.?From McDonald\\'s 2001 commitment to sustainable fish to Walmart¡¦s 2017 Project Gigaton launch, the age of these supply chain journeys ranges widely. This is useful, because it allows for sustainability managers to learn from both pioneers and those that are just starting. Pioneers are critical for teaching others how to avoid common pitfalls.?One such example is Chobani¡¦s Milk Matters program. During a GreenBiz 20 plenary discussion, Chobani President Peter McGuinness spoke about the importance of working with the supply chain department to elevate the financial stability of their farmers and improve sustainability across the value chain. The program includes an \"Environmental Stewardship\" pillar which tracks the greenhouse gas emissions of supply chain partners, thus creating baseline data that will help for Chobani¡¦s long-term goal of creating a sustainable sourcing roadmap.Learning from tried and tried programs can provide context on approaches that work while speaking with those who are just getting started can illustrate which strategies and talking points are the most effective for obtaining stakeholder buy-in. Panelists from the Transparency Summit advocated for obtaining stakeholder buy-in by finding specific hooks. For example, Walmart¡¦s Project Gigaton helps to ensure long term stability in their supply chain and can be used in a new marketing strategy to target changing consumer preferences.???Many groups work exclusively on sector-specific supply chain sustainability, such as the U.S. Roundtable on Sustainable Beef or the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. These groups can serve an important role in providing tools and resources to help companies along their journey.?By bringing together both big and small players in the field, these groups help a sector work collectively to tackle a challenge and have a much larger impact than the efforts of any single company.?What¡¦s more, working with a sector group allows for pre-competitive collaboration, another theme discussed during the Supply Chain Transparency Summit. Pre-competitive collaboration allows for a transparent and frank discussion of the work done to date and its success, while also introducing the possibility of collaborating to create industry-wide standards.?Pioneers are critical for teaching others how to avoid common pitfalls. For example, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition¡¦s Higg Index helps brands, retailers and facilities to measure and score a company or product¡¦s sustainability performance. This empowers apparel companies to make continuous improvements and illustrates the power of sector collaboration.?By transparently working together, companies can learn about best practices and collectively can raise the bar. What¡¦s more, these groups are critical for innovation and research, essential for surfacing the best strategies and policies to work on supply chain emission reduction. Finally, these groups also can provide members the opportunity to try these untested initiatives without negative recourse from the public ¡X as they¡¦ll be seen as leaders and innovators for trying these new practices.??To sum: sector groups can help with innovation, collaboration and risk minimization.Beyond collaborating with industry peers, collaboration with other organizations up and down the supply chain is equally important. Groups such as the Dairy Sustainability Alliance (DSA) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil are multi-stakeholder initiatives that bring together all members of the supply chain and help to create a forum for open dialogue and collaboration.?These groups can determine best practices and provide context for the emission baseline of various members of the supply chain. The DSA¡¦s Dairy Stewardship Commitment (PDF) is one such example of a stakeholder-approved sustainability reporting process that provides a standard tool for all members of the supply chain to use. This allows for stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the expectations and goals of various supply chain strategies.?Groups such as this can also create more effective industry-wide standards, which can set minimum requirements and collectively raise the bar and spread the cost of these initiatives more equitably.?Time and time again, it¡¦s clear that all companies face resource and time constraints. As such, creating uniform standards in the industry can help minimize risk for everyone, while collectively raising standards and reducing costs. Another benefit: these groups are the ideal platform to provide all stakeholders educational information, tools and resources no matter where someone is on their emissions reduction journey.Make sure sustainability professionals are integrated within whichever department manages the supply chain. In order for there to be long-term supply chain emissions reduction, it is critical that the staffers making these decisions are always considering the sustainability implications.?While sustainability might not be the first consideration in the decision-making strategy, it should still be considered. This is critical for creating a priority list of which supply chain issues to target first. Nothing is wrong with targeting low-hanging fruit; however, it is also important to strive for constant progress. Companies should avoid falling into the trap of achieving \"quick wins\" and stagnating afterward due to a lack of strong commitment.?A truly sustainable supply chain is full of obstacles and can be capital-intensive. But sustainability professionals, especially those who have studied the nexus of business and the environment, are well equipped to navigate these challenges and deliver both emission reductions and financial success.?It is prudent that companies have key sustainability personnel in their supply chain departments and recognize that the road to long-term emissions reductions is long. As such, having sustainability professionals in these departments, in positions of power, is critical for long-term success.While the path towards emissions reductions can be long and winding, plenty of tools, resources and collaborators are available to companies as they set forth on this journey.',\n",
              " 'We are most likely to change our transportation habits during big milestones or disruptions in life such as starting a new job or sending kids off to school. Or, of course, like the global pandemic that has shut?many of us inside our homes for much of the time.Global transportation and mobility habits are dramatically shifting on top of the churning tectonic plates of the pandemic. When the world begins to resume some kind of \"new normal,\" those transportation and mobility habits will start to stick in various ways. In this new world, what mobility opportunities will arise?For Seleta Reynolds, manager of the Department of Transportation for Los Angeles and a mobility data advocate, it\\'s a critical time for new partnerships and new ways of thinking to emerge. During a virtual discussion hosted by the UC Davis Institute for Transportation Studies last week, Reynolds said:As the world starts tentatively?opening up after months of sheltering-in-place, one of the biggest mobility challenges will be a likely surge in private car ownership and driving. That\\'s because urban and suburban dwellers are concerned (rightly so) about the safety of public transit, as public transit operators disproportionately have gotten sick and public transit has been linked with New York City\\'s outbreak.That driving surge might be temporary, but it\\'s showing up in early data in South Korea, China and Germany. Data shows that driving is starting to creep back up around the world, while public transit movement data isn\\'t, according to Apple Maps.So how do we address this likely jump in driving? Well, initially, here are four ways: offer better low-carbon mobility options; incentivize electric vehicle purchases; prioritize pedestrian and cycling projects in cities; and Incentivize and promote the upsides of telecommuting.Better mobility options: Reynolds promoted the idea of a \"mobility wallet\" that allows city residents access to mobility services ¡X including shared bikes and scooters, public transit trips or ride-hail rides ¡X and enables such services to be cheaper and more accessible than car ownership. We need to \"disentangle auto ownership with auto access,\" Reynolds said.?Not all mobility players have been collaborative. Some scooter companies have been shutting down shared services in cities to combat the spread of the pandemic, but others such as Spin have begun working with cities to try to offer crucial mobility services to front-line workers. New York City is offering essential workers a free year-long subscription to the shared Citi bikes. It\\'s time for mobility companies to realize that cities are important partners to work with, instead of roadblocks to route around.?At the end of the day, whether people adopt these mobility services over car ownership likely will have to do with pure economics and ease-of-use. \"When people can understand how much money is in a fixed asset like a car, they may make the calculus to get rid of that car,\" said Susan Shaheen, director of the Resilient and Innovative Mobility Initiative at UC Berkeley, during the digital discussion last week.A green stimulus that incentivizes EV: With gas prices so low, it\\'s easy to write off EVs in the short term. That\\'s why policymakers need to make sure to tap already-created EV incentive programs as part of global green stimulus packages. As Bloomberg New Energy Finance\\'s Albert Cheung put it, it\\'s not just about deploying EV charging infrastructure, it\\'s also about incentivizing people to trade in gas-powered clunkers for brand-new clean electric vehicles.Walking and bicycling-centered streets:?As Europe starts to come out of lockdown, it has miles and miles of new bike lanes to access that city governments started to build in a proactive and guerilla-way during the shelter-in-place. During lockdown, the San Francisco Bay Area has created miles of \"slow streets\" that block through-traffic and are giving bikers and walkers a respite from crowded sidewalks and clogged streets.Building mobility infrastructure that prioritizes people and not owned cars is an important way to begin to disincentivize car ownership and incentivize alternative and active forms of transportation. While subtle, such infrastructure could have a very real effect when people start going back to work and public places.?Telecommuting: The stickiest transportation impact of the pandemic just might be telecommuting. While companies have talked about having their workers work remotely for years, tens of millions of workers have been forced into the scenario of making working-from-home, well, work.Many big tech companies plan to continue major work-from-home strategies into 2021. Slashing cars on the roads commuting to office buildings will have a significant effect on lowering carbon emissions related to transportation.',\n",
              " \"Plastics remain one of the most versatile material of the modern age. This quality has led to their appeal and universal application; virtually no modern industry has been left untouched by plastics. The downside to this is the proliferation of plastics into the ecosystem. Images of plastic contaminating the marine environment and causing harm to wildlife and the ecosphere are embedded in the public consciousness.Consumer focus is growing on plastic, specifically packaging and single use-plastics. There is an increasing sense of urgency from all sectors of society to focus on this issue, in addition to focusing on climate change and reducing the impact of plastic on the environment.A polybag is the clear plastic bag that covers every garment from manufacturing to retail stores or consumer homes. If you¡¦ve ever ordered garments online from a retailer, you would have, in all likelihood, had it delivered, neatly sealed within a polybag.If you shop in store, you¡¦re unlikely to see a polybag, as they are removed before the item is brought onto the floor. Polybags are the ubiquitous packaging of the fashion industry ¡X something that unites brands small and large, from sportswear to luxury to fast fashion retailers. It is estimated that up to 180 billion of them are produced every year to store, transport and protect garments, footwear and accessories. It is difficult with current data to say what the precise end-of-use pathway for garment polybags is however, recycling rates of plastic films overall in Europe are around 20 percent and only 12.5 percent (PDF) in the United States, which gives us an indication.\\nImages of plastic contaminating the marine environment and causing harm to wildlife and the ecosphere are embedded in the public consciousness. For the waste in commercial locations (especially distribution centers), companies and retailers often contract with some form of waste collection service that collects clear film waste, including pallet shrink wrap and polybags from distributions centers.?Even though the plastics currently used, low density polyethylene (LDPE), are technically recyclable, the recycling rate could be improved, and contaminants such as ink and paper limit the use of the recycled material in many products. If collected, plastic film typically finds use in applications. For example, it is sometimes recycled into trash bags or incorporated into hard products such as plastic lumber.?Based on the current landscape, we suggest five key efforts companies and retailers can work on right now to reach a more sustainable polybag packaging future.?Brands and retailers should focus on reducing the total amount of material used in their polybag packaging if they wish to reduce their overall impact. Reducing the size of the polybags themselves as well as innovative techniques of folding to fit the garments into smaller polybags is an approach that can be used to reducing plastic usage. Reducing the thickness of polybags is also one strategy that can be successful, or eliminating polybags where viable. By reducing the thickness of the polybags, brands can reduce their overall plastic footprint, because less plastic material will be used.Polybag recycling would be associated with a number of environmental impact reductions, including decreased fossil resource consumption, prevention of landfilled waste and lowered carbon emissions. A key aspiration could be to make polybag material available for closed loop recycling, in which it could be made into new packaging, which has similar specification ¡X in terms material type ¡X to the desired product. This has the benefit of ensuring a supply of material for recycled polybags (and other flexible film packaging) at the same time as reducing demand on virgin fossil resources.\\nBy using their own waste, companies are securing an important feedstock for the production of recycled packaging. Otherwise, there could be supply and demand issues in the future.  We suggest three steps to accomplish this closed loop system:By using their own waste, companies are securing an important feedstock for the production of recycled packaging. Otherwise, there could be supply and demand issues in the future. Further, by collecting waste at every point that it is produced, and having an end destination in mind, companies can ensure that their waste is managed properly and doesn¡¦t escape into the environment.Incorporating recycled content is feasible and continuing to get better. Doing this will support the recycling value chain, and replace virgin, petroleum-based LDPE with a lower carbon alternative. Bio-based LDPE, which has a smaller footprint than its fossil-based counterpart, also can be included. Along with considering the end-of-life impact, companies currently have options to source current LDPE polybags from either bio-based PE (from sugar cane) or recycled PE. Ideally, a commitment should be made to source polybags that include a degree of post-consumer recycled content in addition to pre-consumer/industrial recycled content. This ensures an increased demand for the waste generated from the use of polybags, as well as practically diverting waste that otherwise would have gone to landfill or incineration.Options are developing in this space but are not quite ready for large scale roll out. There may be opportunities for smaller companies especially if the waste is collected and recovered from brands commercial facilities.More infrastructure, research and consumer education are needed before compostable polybags are ready to be implemented on a wide scale.However, this should not stop innovative brands from running trials on such polybags in their internal systems. There is potential scope for piloting and testing specifically where the material is collected and diverted to the appropriate industrial composting facility and where the polybags are not sent to the consumer (from retail stores and distribution centers only). Developments in the local infrastructure need to be closely monitored and only when there is wide enough coverage of composting facilities and compostable waste-stream collections should these be rolled out.\\nMore infrastructure, research and consumer education are needed before compostable polybags are ready to be implemented on a wide scale. As it stands, there are only a few options in this space. Reusable packaging in the context of polybags is tricky but potential, innovative solutions may exist. It is currently more viable to consider reusable packaging for e-commerce mailing, especially for brands with circular business models.Polybags travel over vast distances, through many nodes from manufacturing sites, overwhelmingly in the east, to end markets all over the word. So travel distance may start to make an environmental impact on this scale. For example, it would require shipping polybags in bulk from Europe to Asia and back again.Additionally, it¡¦s also a very complex network of manufacturers and distribution centers and would require intense collaboration on a large scale.A solution would have to be engineered that is lightweight, transparent (able to view the garment and hang tag in some way) and easily maintainable for many cycles and long shipping journeys.It is a daunting task but these problems are not impossible to solve. The scale of the challenge is not insurmountable, especially if the industry collaborates to test and scale alternative solutions. Our data shows that recycling polybags, reducing the amount of plastic material and incorporating recycled content are the most popular initiatives overall that are being pursued. However, only a minority of brands are pursuing these initiatives.Scott Nelson of European Outdoor Group and Erin Hiat of Retail Industries Leaders Association also contributed to this article.

              " 'From?locust swarms in Africa?threatening food security, to raging?wildfires in Australia, to?flooding?affecting countries worldwide and more, communities are trying to cope with the effects of climate change. Local leadership, site-specific strategies and knowledge of surrounding environments are essential to building resilience to climate impacts. However, these proven methods are often ignored when external partners get involved, and?less than 10 percent?of international climate funds go to local communities most directly affected by climate change.The Global Commission on Adaptation¡¦s new paper, \"Scaling Local and Community-Based Adaptation,\"?presents case study evidence that effective climate change adaptation is inherently local. No one-size-fits-all technical solution can replace a contextual focus that puts people¡¦s well-being, needs and aspirations first.Here are five critical benefits to having local actors lead climate resilience strategies:Effective adaptation solutions should manage the uncertainties of climate risk in ways tailored to specific locations. There is no universal quick fix to distribute across countries and communities. When adaptation is overseen at the local level, communities can adopt?flexible and incremental solutions that?accommodate future changes in hazard intensity and frequency.The Fijian village of Vunidogoloa experienced such frequent and disastrous flooding, coastal erosion and soil salinization that the villagers appealed to the government for relocation assistance. Villagers, local and national governments and the International Labor Organization developed a robust plan specific to Vunidogoloa. Working together, they evaluated the natural and spiritual resources the villagers were sacrificing for resettlement, and how their new village could be designed to offset those losses.The?transition?included fishponds to offset the?villagers¡¦?reduced access to the ocean, introduced more resilient crop varieties?and provided coconut copra dryers?to generate new livelihood options.?Additionally, voluntary social support from?local and regional religious?organizations was available to help villagers cope with the?psychological effects?of losing their former home.The benefits of local adaptation outweigh the estimated costs. Avoiding loss and damage from climate stressors saves money, which unlocks economic and social potential for the area ¡X an interplay of co-benefits that the Commission¡¦s 2019 report, \"Adapt Now,\"?boils down to a simple choice: delay and pay; or plan and prosper.The Hawke¡¦s Bay region of New Zealand, frequently inundated by storms and coastal erosion,?fortified itself?with local adaptation measures to replace losses with returns. Without intervention, the nation stood to lose an estimated 7 million in social outcomes alone within 10 years; within 100 years, losses could have grown exponentially.To counter this, the district and city council partnered with Tangata Whenua Indigenous people to develop an adaptation strategy with businesses, asset managers and other community members. The resulting solutions included coastal defense structures for the short- to medium-term, and gradual relocation away from the ocean for the long-term. This will protect the 65 percent?of the population that lives within 3.1 miles of the coast, as well as tourist attractions such as renowned wineries and architecture. This transparent and participatory approach has been recreated across New Zealand for its successful integration of local experience, cultural knowledge and technical expertise.Programs that account for regional inequalities can avoid excluding or discriminating against marginalized groups. Encouraging the most vulnerable people to participate?in decision-making can make programs more effective for the community as a whole, while prioritizing the needs of the region¡¦s poorest.This strategy worked in Bangladesh, where a program to enhance the resilience of coastal communities was designed to be accessible to women who cannot travel far from their homes. The program focused on cultivating forests, fish and fruit to restore mangrove forests ¡X which can act as a buffer against storms and flooding ¡X and increase food production. Artificial dikes provided garden beds for fruits, vegetables?and timber trees, while their corresponding ditches held aquaculture ponds. Because the?ditches and dikes?are close?to households, many more women had the opportunity to generate food and income, while contributing ecological co-benefits through creating natural sea barriers and minimizing coastal erosion.Local adaptation solutions are more likely to be effective because communities approach adaptation holistically. They experience the complex relationships between adaptation measures and other development priorities such as poverty alleviation, disaster impact reduction and inclusive socioeconomic development, and reflect these connections in their climate solutions.In Ethiopia, for example, subsistence farmers in the Kalu Woreda district are extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts. To address drought-induced food insecurity, the Ethiopian government?channeled food aid toward ecosystem restoration?to increase productivity. With an early warning weather system, new drought-resistant, high-yield crop varieties and agricultural programming focused on female heads of households, the program was able to address climate impacts, food security and women¡¦s empowerment. Cultivating plants for watershed protection, medicines and biodiesel production added a cross-cutting component to Kalu Woreda¡¦s approach.Local knowledge is a vast and underused resource that is more accessible and relevant to programs designed for a specific place. Embedding?local?knowledge in adaptation measures makes them more inclusive, eases uptake and makes them more sustainable, while boosting communities¡¦ sense of ownership.For instance, when melting glaciers in Pakistan¡¦s Hunza Valley threatened to flood villages, indigenous knowledge about the region informed a comprehensive?community-based monitoring?and early warning system. Villagers formed volunteer groups to?hike into the mountains to observe the glaciers each month. Their knowledge, combined with new methods of data collection and photographic documentation, allowed for comprehensive monitoring of glacier-fed lakes to improve their flood preparedness.This year, the Global Commission¡¦s?Locally Led Action Track?and its 28 partner organizations are convening regional grassroots-donor dialogues, publishing research on?climate finance reform?and working with grassroots networks to get funding to the local level. The Locally Led Action Track aims to position communities and local level actors as leaders entitled to greater inclusion and recognition of their expertise and role in developing sustainable, equitable and effective climate solutions.Adaptation is a global issue with transboundary implications, but effective action begins at the local level. Local voices and priorities are urgently needed in an honest and long overdue conversation on the systemic causes of vulnerability which prevent more transformative solutions from flourishing. The Locally Led Action Track is working to ensure climate resilience strategies bring local actors into the fold to address these causes and build a more effective path forward, not only for local communities, but for the world at large.',\n",
              " \"City life can be deeply unfair. This was true before the coronavirus pandemic exposed just how differently the rich and poor are able to cope with lockdowns, from the ability to work from home to access to green space. The pandemic's devastating impacts on vulnerable groups have only widened existing fault lines tied to income, race and postal codes.Cities face much longer-term trends underlying vulnerability for hundreds of millions of people. Even as poverty has declined globally, the share of poor people living in urban areas is rising worldwide. Meanwhile, cities are more likely to experience flooding and extreme heat than in years past, and the poorest residents are hardest hit by these events. Increasingly, cities need solutions that address both climate change and inequality together.The good news is that cities remain creative dynamos, constantly innovating and changing. Below are five big ideas for how to reduce urban inequality and respond to climate change at the same time. Chosen from more than 260 submissions, these projects are the finalists for the 2020-2021 WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities.Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi, is perched precariously alongside the Ngong River. Home to more than 300,000 people, this informal settlement is plagued by poor drainage and sanitation, precarious housing and limited public space. Few city services reach the neighborhood. As climate change has brought larger storms and heavier rains, Kibera's residents are among the hardest hit in Nairobi ¡X facing flooding, sewage overflows and mudslides. Up to 40 percent of homes in the neighborhood regularly experience flooding.In 2006, the nonprofit Kounkuey Design Initiative launched in Kibera with an approach to improving drainage and sanitation that relies on participatory, step-by-step upgrades of existing infrastructure. Working with community-based organizations, the initiative created a network of public spaces where both built and natural infrastructure, including areas of restored riverbank, help protect the community from floods and reduce pollution across Nairobi's watershed.Co-created and managed by local residents, Kounkuey Design Initiative's 11 public spaces provide the community with more than just flood controls. They are also places to play, learn and earn a living. The projects build a sense of ownership and pride within the community ¡X and they work, showing it's possible to give all city residents safe, accessible and climate-resilient public spaces.In the U.K. capital, air pollution ¡X much of it from car traffic ¡X is a problem of both climate change and social justice. Low-income and historically marginalized Londoners are most likely to breathe polluted air, yet least likely to own cars. While over 95 percent of residents are exposed to illegal and unsafe air pollution, children, immigrants and people of color experience air pollution that is 16 percent worse on average.Efforts to combat air pollution go back to 2003, when London introduced its congestion charge, a fee applied to all vehicles driven within the city center. In 2019 the mayor's office took this policy a step further by implementing the world's first Ultra Low Emission Zone. Now, in 8 square miles of central London, all drivers must abide by strict vehicle emissions standards or pay a fee. Revenue from the fee is then reinvested into the city's public transport system.The policy has led to 44,000 fewer polluting vehicles in the city every day, and a 44 percent reduction in roadside nitrogen dioxide (a gas harmful to human health) in the first 10 months. Fewer cars also means fewer greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.The Ultra Low Emission Zone doesn't work alone; it complements a package of efforts, from investments in electric buses to low-emission school zones, aimed at aggressively reducing air pollutants across the city. A targeted approach prioritizes marginalized communities with the worst air quality. The Ultra Low Emission Zone is set to cover 18 times more area by the end of 2021, to encompass London's outlying areas as well.The city of Rosario is already tackling rising temperatures and precipitation due to climate change. These changes are happening amid a lingering legacy of urban inequality from Argentina's 2001 economic crisis, which left more than one-quarter of Rosario's residents unemployed. When the city began its strategic climate planning in 2014, officials sought to reorient the strengths of existing initiatives toward increased climate resilience, starting with the city's flagship urban agriculture program.Rosario's urban agriculture program gives low-income residents ownership of unused public land to cultivate for food. Over 185 acres of land have been converted into gardens for fruits and vegetables sold across seven local farmers markets. This conversion of land is providing new income to poorer residents. It also helps the city increase resilience to floods and combat the urban heat island effect. The gardens' soil absorbs water during heavy rain, alleviating pressure on weak drainage systems and naturally cooling the air.Since the program has evolved into a cornerstone of Rosario's climate response, its previously undervalued climate change mitigation benefits also have become more apparent, as more local food helps lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation in the food supply chain.Over the past three decades, Monterrey has grown into a sprawling, low-density city ¡X growth that has come with high environmental and social costs. As Monterrey has built out, many residents and businesses have left the city center for more car-dependent outer neighborhoods. Violent crime from the country's drug war caused even more residents to move outward, intensifying the cycle of sprawl that leaves many residents needing to travel very long distances for essential services.In 2010, violence came to a head and touched the Tec community directly with the deaths of two students. Faced with the choice of moving out of the city center to keep students safe or working with the community to develop a solution, the university chose the latter. Tecnol?gico de Monterrey created a team to pioneer DistritoTec, an initiative to create more dense inner-city neighborhoods, and draw residents back into a safe, desirable Monterrey.DistritoTec creates compact, mixed-use neighborhoods that minimize the need for car travel and provide an array of urban amenities, such as parks, community centers and event programming. The approach fosters sustainable mobility through its complete streets program, which installs bicycle lanes and pedestrian crossings, and revitalizes underused and abandoned spaces into public parks and plazas.The university-led model also has transformed Monterrey's public policy to better support a more equitable, sustainable urban future, including a new regulation allowing inner-city neighborhoods to increase density, a new collaborative model for district governance, improving access for all residents to core urban services and making it easier to get around without a car.In Ahmedabad, urbanization intersects with climate change-induced heat extremes, water scarcity, flooding and public health. As in Nairobi and many other cities with large informal settlements, residents of slums are particularly affected, as their homes are less protected from flooding and extreme heat. Women are also more vulnerable to environmental hazards at home, as their livelihoods often depend on home-based work.After a deadly heat wave in 2010 claimed more than 1,300 lives, the Mahila SEWA Housing Trust began training local women leaders (Vikasinis) to conduct climate vulnerability assessments in Ahmedabad's slums. The group also tested practical climate resilience solutions for households and neighborhoods through partnerships with technical institutions, innovators and technology providers.By bringing together this diverse set of actors, the housing trust and the Vikasinis closed the gap between solutions on offer and the specific needs of slum communities. They produced technically suitable and financially attainable upgrades?¡X such as white paint to reflect sunlight off rooftops and keep homes cooler, rooftop catchment systems to collect water during heavy rains, and water meters to help the community avoid wastage ¡X that mitigate climate risks from the ground up.Local communities and female leaders have increased access to city-level initiatives and decision-making, and have helped make climate resilience a municipal priority. Beyond Ahmedabad, the Mahila Housing Trust has inspired similar models, which reach more than 125,000 people in 107 slums across six other South Asian cities.Climate change is an important driver of urban inequality in many cities. However, as these five big ideas show, well-designed and inclusive climate action can itself help cities become more equitable, thriving places for all residents.\",\n",
              " 'It¡¦s been a big year for clean energy. From policy to action, the public and private sectors are spurring forward the great energy transition in meaningful ways. Here are the five biggest stories from the year past, and why they¡¦ll matter months and years into the future.The weather this year was weird. No part of the U.S. was spared. The heat dome in the Pacific Northwest. The polar vortex in Texas. Hurricanes in New York. Tornadoes in the Midwest ¡X in December. Blizzards in Hawaii. Fires in the West, fueled by a megadrought. Extreme flooding across the globe.?All signs point to weather getting more extreme as the impacts of climate change take root.?The weather was also a wake-up call for the nation¡¦s energy infrastructure. Power outages jumped 73 percent in the U.S. last year ¡X from 770 million hours in 2019 to 1.33 billion in 2020. More extreme weather will certainly mean more outages ¡X and with them, health, safety and economic damages.?As a result, communities and organizations are beginning to think about the value of resilience in a new light. More utilities are considering virtual power plant programs, giving their customers more resilience and their operations more flexibility. Companies are looking to install backup generation.?As we collectively better understand the value of resilience ¡X and the cost of losing power ¡X more offerings at more price points are sure to emerge.?This year marked a breakthrough in efforts to decarbonize one of the largest climate culprits: steel, responsible for about 7 percent of energy-related emissions.First, the United States and the European Union agreed to use embodied emissions as a metric when importing steel in what the White House calls \"the world¡¦s first carbon-based sectoral arrangement.\" This helps incentivize a clean steel market that can¡¦t be undercut by cheaper, dirtier options.?Then, during COP26, 40 world leaders signed onto an agreement to decarbonize five high-carbon sectors: steel; transport; agriculture; hydrogen; and electricity. The countries represent more than 70 percent of the world¡¦s economy.?Meanwhile, industry is showing that clean steel is possible ¡X and is happening. Volvo announced plans to make cars with fossil-free steel by 2026. A steel mill in Colorado is running (mostly) on solar. Boston Metal figured out a carbon dioxide-free steel smelting process.?Taken together, this is meaningful movement towards decarbonizing one of the world¡¦s most stubborn sectors. The industrial sector is a significant contributor to the climate crisis, responsible for roughly a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, but decarbonized solutions are either non-existent, not market-ready or not cheap enough (yet). The progress made with green steel gives me hope that we can do hard things.?Long-duration energy storage ¡X defined as a system that can store energy for more than 10 hours ¡X has been the Next Big Thing for about 20 years. But 2021 may just have been the tipping point.?In July, the U.S. Department of Energy threw down the gauntlet, launching an Energy Earthshot Initiative to drive down the costs of long-duration energy storage by 90 percent by 2030.?\"We¡¦re going to bring hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy onto the grid over the next few years, and we need to be able to use that energy wherever and whenever it¡¦s needed,\" Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.?Whether a result of the Earthshot announcement or simply good timing, shortly thereafter a tremendous amount of finance flowed to the sector, with funds backing new technologies and companies that have the potential to unlock the Holy Grail of deep decarbonization.?Energy Vault secured 100 million in Series C funding, FlexGen announced a 150 million equity commitment, EnerVenue announced a 100 million in Series A funding, Malta announced it raised 60 million in Series B financing and Form Energy closed 240 million in Series D capital.As the clean energy procurement market matures, some corporate buyers are looking beyond the number of megawatts to more holistic criteria when considering new energy deals.?This strategic lens can be used to assess upstream impacts, such as an energy company¡¦s labor practices or a solar panel manufacturer¡¦s material sourcing. It also can be used to ensure renewable energy deployments are supporting the local community and are creating good-paying jobs that support diversity, equity and inclusion.On the environmental side, deals are increasingly taking into account land use and the full life cycle of materials used in clean energy technologies, including circular design of solar panels and wind turbine blades.?This trend was highlighted as one of the year¡¦s major trends by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA)¡¦s annual State of the Market report. It is also the topic of Salesforce\\'s excellent report \"More than a Megawatt,\" which outlines best practices for renewable energy buyers.??Service providers are also looking to provide more holistic information to buyers. LevelTen, a renewable transaction platform, launched a new scoring tool this year that factors in a renewable project¡¦s community, conservation and climate impacts. Enel Green Power also highlights this as one of the top five renewable energy trends in the coming year.?Something funny has been going on with energy supply across the globe.?Natural gas prices are spiking in Europe, with people looking down the barrel of a colder-than usual winter. Cost of coal went up. Strained supply chains have spiked the cost of gasoline.?On the renewable energy side, supply chain disruptions have increased the cost of projects. This is thanks to a confluence of factors, including an increased cost for raw components, higher shipping costs and a run on available deals as corporations and communities work to ink deals before clean energy target dates and the sunset of tax credits.?As a result, some corporate buyers are waiting for costs to fall before engaging in new projects.The fact that a marginal increase in costs could derail important progress in the clean energy transition reflects the moral hazard of focusing on economics as the motivation to decarbonize.',\n",
              " 'Just before the start of term, history teacher India Brown is at home, where she¡¦s preparing to begin teaching remote lessons again. Brown began working at Fulham Cross girls¡¦ school, in south-west London, four years ago after studying history and politics at Newcastle University and completing a PGCE at the University of Cambridge. She was a silver winner in the outstanding new teacher category at the Pearson National Teaching Award in 2019.Dialling in to speak to Brown is Nickael Briggs, a sociology teacher at Ark Acton academy in west London, where she is also an assistant principal. She studied sociology at the University of Leicester, earned a PGCE with University College London, and has been teaching for eight years. She won the outstanding leader Jack Petchey award in 2015, and was named national teacher of the year by the charity First Give in 2017.India Brown (IB): I don¡¦t know if this resonates with you Nickael, but now I¡¦m in my fourth year of teaching, I definitely feel as though I¡¦ve found my feet. I took on responsibility for history when we went into lockdown last year, and it¡¦s been great to have direction over the curriculum. We are adapting it all the time and I¡¦m determined to make sure history tells women¡¦s stories too.Nickael Briggs (NB): I¡¦ve been teaching for double the amount of time, but it¡¦s so interesting you say that about your fourth year because I had the same experience. This is my third school, and my first year as an assistant principal. I also lead on school culture and the curriculum.I¡¦m from south London originally, and when I was at school teachers didn¡¦t expect us to go very far because we were from deprived backgrounds. But I remember one English teacher who really pushed us. Despite all of our disadvantages, she always had high expectations of us. She sparked my love of learning and motivated me to go into the profession. I wanted to give something back.IB: What I love about teaching is everyone you speak to has an experience of a teacher, or a class, or a subject that has stuck with them. For me, it was my history teacher ¡V I still think about her all the time. I grew up on the south coast, near Eastbourne, and I went to a girl¡¦s school down there, which is a similar setting to the school I¡¦m in now.I didn¡¦t know what I wanted to do after finishing my degree, and it was my mum who suggested I think about sharing my passion for history. I liked the idea of going into a career where I could motivate and inspire people. But the PGCE was a challenge! Teaching is such a complex skill ¡V I¡¦m still learning and improving all the time. I love it so much more than I thought I would.NB: It¡¦s so nice to hear teachers talk passionately about the profession because at the moment it¡¦s easy to lose sight of how rewarding it is. The more experience I have, the more I¡¦ve realised how important it is not only to teach my lessons, but also to help young people understand that if they engage, they can have the future of their choosing.I love being able to give young people extracurricular opportunities and I¡¦m really keen on building debating into our school day. Young people are so used to communicating through technology, there¡¦s a risk they¡¦ll lose some of the basic communication skills, such as being able to form an opinion and having an informed, respectful debate.We run a debate club after school, where university students teach debating skills; we¡¦re involved with charities, which gets our students into volunteering and social action; and we take part in competitions to provide opportunities for public speaking. I want our students to understand that doing things out of their comfort zones is OK.IB: I try to bring drama into my classroom to bring history to life. I can¡¦t teach the Battle of Hastings without getting the crown out, giving someone the job of being the king, making someone else a French Norman, and organising a stampeding army. Not only do students enjoy the lesson more, they remember it and get to interact with the subject in a different way. Last year at our open evening, some year 9s performed the Sister Suffragette song from Mary Poppins after learning about the fight for female suffrage.I definitely remember those sorts of lessons from my own school days. And now, if I¡¦m enjoying a lesson, I can see that the class is more inclined to get on board as well. It¡¦s one of the reasons I like working with young people day in, day out.NB: Yes! You¡¦ve got to love these young people. It really transforms your experience with them when they know you¡¦re working together as a team. I think there¡¦s also a misconception with teaching that you have to be a ready-made expert. But you learn so much every single day.And I don¡¦t think people should be put off by coming into the profession when they¡¦re young. There are so many continuing professional development, training and coaching opportunities available to help newly qualified teachers (NQTs). It¡¦s also really inspirational for the students to see younger teachers giving back and trying to help them along their way.IB: It really is the best job in the world. I can¡¦t imagine doing anything else. It¡¦s a huge privilege to be able to be a champion for these young people. Thank you for the chat. It¡¦s given me a positive burst of energy.NB: It¡¦s just so nice to be able to reflect on who we do this for.',\n",
              " 'My approach to teaching did not start with me, but with my ancestors. My grandparents arrived in the UK from Jamaica and St Kitts and Nevis, and my grandmother, Locita Brandy, was the head cook at a primary school in Moss Side, Manchester, which my father attended.On one occasion she walked past a classroom where the teacher was reading a book with the N-word in the title to a group of predominantly Black Caribbean students. My grandmother campaigned, successfully, for the removal of that book not only from the school but all local schools and even Manchester City Library. She was an early-activist and later became a councillor.The removal of racist teaching literature in schools was a significant milestone for the development of what we educators call an anti-racist curriculum, an approach to teaching that understands the unique role classrooms have in challenging racist ideas, policies and structures in society. It¡¦s an approach that, as a Black man, teacher and parent, I have the opportunity to implement, decades later, in my own community of schools, for this generation and those that follow.In the late 1950s, racism and rejection were commonplace for colonial migrants and their British-born children. Black children were labelled as educationally subnormal compared with their white counterparts, and immigrant children were failed.I was a pupil between 1996 and 2001, attending a traditionally white, inner-city secondary school. There, they adopted a colourblind approach even though the Black and Asian cohort of pupils increased annually: topics relating to identity and diversity were excluded, and so were topics about cultural similarities. But ignoring diversity did not help make me and the other Black and Asian kids feel included. Instead we felt invisible, we felt excluded. And many were: exclusion rates were significantly higher among Black children than the national average.It was at my supplementary Saturday school that I unpicked what I experienced through mainstream education. There, I was taught by qualified Black teachers who reinforced positive self-image, confidence and helped bridge the attainment gap. This taught me, from an early age that positive Black representation in schools, alongside a curriculum that reflects global society, is essential. Studies show that Black students perform better when they have a Black teacher. And from my own experience this is borne out.Nonetheless, Black teachers remain underrepresented in education. When I started teaching design technology, in 2015, I was the only Black teacher in my school and many Black and Asian pupils gravitated towards me. I understood the barriers impacting their learning and to them I was a visual representation of success in education. A diverse teaching staff and leadership creates positive stereotypes and mindsets, and improves aspiration.Before starting my master¡¦s in educational leadership and enrolling on a BME leadership programme, I hadn¡¦t heard of any Black headteachers. I decided to research underrepresentation. Off I went down the rabbit hole, discovering Black trailblazers such as: David Hermitt, who has just retired as chief executive at the Learning Alliance, and is pinned on my vision board alongside Diana Osagie, founder of the Academy of Women¡¦s Leadership, headteacher Paul Mundy-Castle and Rosemary Campbell-Stephens, former headteacher and international consultant.In 2020, I piloted an anti-racist approach at my school, Oasis Academy MediaCityUK, in Salford, and the intention is to roll out the approach across 52 schools within the Oasis Community Learning chain, extending to more than 28,000 children.Inspired by pupils¡¦ perceptions, we have introduced a culturally-inclusive curriculum that integrates multiple perspectives to national curriculum topics. For example, in my own subject, where the exam board requires students to study from a choice of 16 designers, all white European or American, such as William Morris and Norman Foster, at Oasis MediaCity, we teach the contributions of all designers, including pioneering modern Black and Asian creatives otherwise excluded from the conversation, such as architects Sir David Adjaye, Kunl? Adeyemi and Zaha Hadid.With almost one-third of pupils from families who are not white British, the teaching workforce is crying out for parallel representation. Creating classrooms where all students can prosper and be the best version of themselves, where we can improve the life chances and aspirations of future generations, is the greatest reward and justification for entering the profession.I do this as I work towards my own aspiration of becoming a headteacher. My ethos is to implement an approach where school is viewed through the perspectives of the pupils, to accommodate inclusive communities and foster mindsets of integration and respect. I want to be part of the change so my own children ¡V and all children ¡V can be in a positive, reflective learning environment that caters for all.',\n",
              " 'Entering a classroom as a student teacher was like turning on a switch. I was a young-looking 22-year-old and mistaken for the new girl. Many of the class were from backgrounds like mine but hadn¡¦t had a Black teacher before. When I began teaching, they were willing to listen to what I had to say. We¡¦d share a joke but they took me seriously too. My second placement was at a boys¡¦ school that was mostly white, with a big focus on sport. It couldn¡¦t have been more different but they took me just as seriously. I realised, then, that this was a career that, with the right support, I could be great at.I have never been short of role models. As a schoolgirl in south London, my teacher Miss Peterkin inspired me. She was a Black woman and head of year. She was quite strict and some girls didn¡¦t get on with her, but I was hard-working and could go to the staffroom to ask her advice about life in and outside school. I am second generation Black British Caribbean. My grandparents were part of the Windrush generation and my heritage is hugely important to me. My dad worked in automotive engineering and now he¡¦s a college lecturer, where he is well-liked and respected. Since entering teaching, it has been important to me to continue the legacy of people like him and Miss Peterkin.I feel comfortable and confident in the classroom. I studied chemistry at university and had imagined a career in forensics, but realised I was too sociable for life in a lab. In the final year of my degree, at Kingston University, our project work focused on improving practical skills in secondary schools. My lecturers then asked if I¡¦d considered teaching. I took this on board, particularly as I¡¦d realised how much I enjoyed working with young people, and I knew I was passionate about passing on my knowledge. I went on to do my teacher training at King¡¦s College London, and I was very happy when my mentors said that I had a natural presence in the classroom and an ability to connect with students.Relatability is a big thing for young people. When I started at my current school, the pupils were excited to have a teacher they considered ¡§cool¡¨ and from a similar background to them. Students respond to people they respect and like, so you have to find opportunities to connect with them wherever and however they¡¦re inclined to communicate. I always wear heels and a skirt or trouser suit to school, and the girls love to talk about clothes, music or hair with me ¡V as well as about chemistry. The comments I hear from them, particularly Black girls who tell me how important it is to see a woman like them succeed, have a positive impact on all of us.At university, I was the only Black woman in my cohort. I am passionate about changing that representation so the next generation can fulfil its potential. In 2018, I was named Black Young Professionals Network Role Model of the Year and given a Harris Federation Transforming Lives Award for engaging young people in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. In 2019, I started up Young Gifted and STEM ¡V an online network to improve engagement in those subjects among Black and minority ethnic British students. We connect them with role models from industry, colleges and universities and provide opportunities to learn new skills with the aim of boosting representation in the Stem workforce.I want new teachers to feel supported so that the students can always come first. Finding the right school is really important and I was lucky, at my second school, to discover an environment where I could truly thrive. I¡¦m now in my sixth year here and have progressed to head of chemistry, head of science and now associate assistant principal, overseeing the sixth form. Now that I am in a leadership position, I ensure that new teachers can lean on more experienced colleagues for support.As a teacher, I¡¦ve been on a journey and never looked back. In what other job would I get to be sociable, passionate about my subject, and build relationships with about 150 different people every day? I lead a science department of 11 women and half of us are Black, which sends a positive, representative message to students. I watch them grow from 11-year-olds to confident, educated individuals at 18. For me, teaching a kid to fulfil their potential is a dream.',\n",
              " 'Otters are not the most Christmassy of animals. They never volunteer to drag sleighs. They rarely flutter picturesquely around holly bushes. And their presence has never been evoked in any carol or depicted on the cover of any seasonal greeting card ¡K as far as I know anyway.But for me, that small river-based mammal is now forever bound up with my ideas of festive cheer, goodwill to all humans and living room-based trees. Because whenever I see one, my first thought is: ¡§Best. Christmas present. Ever.¡¨In 2019, I was given the gift of otters. Or, more specifically, a voucher for an ¡§Otter Feeding Experience¡¨ at a Cambridgeshire wildlife park, purchased by my wife. I bloody love otters ¡V I have ever since I was a kid. They¡¦re just such adorably weird little dudes. You know that sea otters hold hands when they sleep, so that they don¡¦t float apart? Or that they juggle stones when they get excited? And the rest of the time, they store their favourite stone in a mini pouch by their armpit? There¡¦s something about those little be-snouted kooks ¡V they make me smile.But, in all honesty, most of the time, I forget how much I even like them. Otters do not feature in my day-to-day thoughts. Months can pass without an aquatic fluffball crossing my mind. For most gift buyers, this might suggest that they wouldn¡¦t be an ideal candidate for a world-beating Christmas present. Not the woman I married, though.My wife is an incredibly mindful shopper. Every year she devotes herself to inspiring the surprise and delight that comes from receiving an unexpected treasure. Intense amounts of personal thought are poured into each purchase, so while I might be getting something shaped like a book or a juicer, it feels like a physical representation of the sentiment: ¡§I love you¡¨. The less chance I¡¦m expecting the gift? The more she knows I¡¦ll like it.And boy was she right. Never in a million years, did I envisage opening a card to find a voucher (handmade, naturally) for an otter feeding experience. Plus, even if I had, I don¡¦t think I¡¦d have guessed quite how giddily excited I¡¦d be about it. The love and consideration she¡¦d lavished on me! The unbelievable depth of her understanding of me! The tiny little snouts!I lasted all of about two hours before excitedly booking our trip to see the otters. Although, naturally, I scheduled it for spring, when the weather would be a bit nicer. And then the pandemic struck, and my otter feeding experience was cancelled.You know what gives you an even greater appreciation of getting away from the big city? Spending months and months staring at the walls of a small London flat. We rescheduled the trip, of course, and by the time lockdown ended and I had been trapped in a stinky metropolis for seven months. I was desperate for fun. I yearned for nature. Frankly, I¡¦d have cooed ¡§Aw!¡¨ at a rat eating fried chicken from a bin.So within minutes of stepping off the train in a small Cambridgeshire village, I was completely engulfed with joy. You could hear the cacophony of adorable otter squeaks about 200 metres from their enclosure. Our mere appearance alongside caused them to spend 15 minutes engaged in a bizarre, poolside pre-lunchtime parade, where they frantically chirped their way around their enclosure in single file. Occasionally they¡¦d form a choir in front of us, serenade us on their hind legs, and then return to their conga line.An otterkeeper ¡V if that¡¦s the right word ¡V appeared with a fish platter. He handed us a broom handle with a rubber ball on the end, and asked us to lower it into the otters¡¦ pen and reward their antics with food. We watched the adorable spectacle of otters taking turns to put their tiny arms around the ball and hug it like a long-lost friend. Then we flipped the broom around. On to their tip-toes they went, eagerly pushing little button noses against the end of the pole.It was one of the most utterly charming hours of my life. Every time we¡¦d throw a fish, their excited noises were like a chorus of squeaky dog-toys. After lunch, they all scurried indoors, and we watched through a pane of glass as they snuggled into a snoozy, spent heap ¡V a big floppy mess of cuddling otters.And coming as it did after an intense few months of barely leaving our flat made it all the more perfect. Should a grown man feel weirdly emotional after flinging some fish to a group of river dwelling animals? Probably not. Did I? Yep.It was great. Not only was it a personal, thoughtful gift, but it was made all the better by the circumstances. So, as we wandered around the wildlife park, I thanked my wife for the best Christmas present I¡¦d ever received. It couldn¡¦t have been more special, I told her.At which point, one of my best friends stepped out from behind the tiger enclosure with his entire family in tow. A sly smile spread across my wife¡¦s face and I went into a state of shock, given that I hadn¡¦t seen him in more than a year since he¡¦d moved away from London to ¡K Cambridgeshire. Right. Should have seen that coming.Honestly, I don¡¦t know how she¡¦ll even manage to come close this year. I¡¦d say she¡¦s disadvantaged now by the fact that there¡¦s no national lockdown to heighten the anticipation of whatever she buys me. But the truth is that it doesn¡¦t really matter. I¡¦ve already had the perfect Christmas gift.',\n",
              " 'As a student, it can be daunting to think about the transition from scholar to employee. After years of lectures, workshops, assessments, cooking on a budget and socialising, the leap to the workplace is often difficult to imagine.But while you¡¦ve been studying, you¡¦ll have developed many qualities that make you far more employable than you may realise ¡V think metacognition skills (that¡¦s critical thinking), an ability to hit deadlines, and money management nous (anybody who can live on a budget of 85p a day is a financial genius). There¡¦s more good news: due to the skills shortage, organisations are fighting for young talent. In fact, 80% of businesses are planning to hire more staff over the next year, according to a recent survey by the recruitment company Hays.The University of Law knows all about preparing people for the world of work. Employability is embedded into all of its courses, and 94% of its postgraduate students were in highly skilled occupations 15 months after graduating.Here, Marco Mongiello, pro vice-chancellor at The University of Law Business School, shares advice on what you should be doing to prepare yourself for today¡¦s job market, because, even when employers are fighting for talent, there¡¦s always competition for the best roles.Make use of your critical-thinking skills¡§If you want to come across as credible to employers, the critical thinking you¡¦ve acquired at university will be a big help. Instead of giving textbook answers in an interview, start a dialogue with your interviewer and engage with them. Don¡¦t be afraid of scenario questions where you might be asked to devise solutions for a product that is struggling to sell online, engage with the interviewer by applying your critical thinking ¡V for example, you may ask what happened to a previous service that disappeared from the market.¡§Rather than just explaining things you learned at university, use them in a practical way instead. Think of a carpenter. They might want to show off their sophisticated new hammer, but people aren¡¦t interested in that. Instead, they want the carpenter to use the hammer to solve a problem. It¡¦s the same with your academic knowledge ¡V use it to find solutions.¡¨Get the most out of your part-time job¡§Part-time jobs are a fantastic way to develop employability skills, but if you view your job as something where you can work as little as possible, you won¡¦t learn much. If you¡¦re waiting tables in a cafe, for example, volunteer to do the accounts to get financial experience, or devise a solution for the chef who gets stressed when goods they¡¦ve ordered don¡¦t arrive on time. Show that you can think critically and add value beyond your prescribed tasks. Don¡¦t forget: if you¡¦ve managed to increase customers or save costs, these are quantifiable metrics that are brilliant to add to your CV or LinkedIn profile.¡¨Develop teamwork skills¡§Being a good leader isn¡¦t about being in charge, but about the ability to make other members of a team contribute at their best. Being able to motivate others is a cultural intelligence employers love ¡V these skills are usually acquired on the job, but they can also be picked up in team sports or university clubs or societies, and indeed while working on your coursework in teams.¡¨Build your LinkedIn profile ...¡§Many students think there¡¦s nothing to put on their LinkedIn because they have no experience. Firstly, remember all successful entrepreneurs started with a blank CV. You can also enhance your profile by including any relevant experience ¡V no matter how small ¡V such as summer charity work, progress made in a part-time job or challenges you¡¦ve faced during your studies. Follow any organisations you¡¦d like to work for and keep your profile relevant (that prize you won at primary school has a definite expiry date) and consistent across platforms, and reflected in your CV.¡¨¡K and start networking there now¡§If you¡¦ve identified an organisation you¡¦d like to work for, you can start engaging with the CEO by commenting on blogposts they¡¦ve posted on LinkedIn. It¡¦s a great way to get yourself on their radar and mark yourself out as a thought leader. But make sure you engage with them; demanding they give you a job is a sure-fire way to burn your chances. You could also try contacting university alumni working within that organisation to learn more about the company and get them on side.¡¨Make sure your digital footprint is squeaky-clean¡§Don¡¦t be alarmed, but employers will browse your social media when considering you for a job. And if they spy disgraceful shots of you and your friends on Instagram, they probably won¡¦t select you for an interview. Try to weave in some business nous to your posts, too. For example, if you showcase your surfing hobby on Instagram, post some content about surf entrepreneurs ¡V it shows potential employers you¡¦re thinking about business.¡¨Tailor your application towards the role¡§One of the biggest mistakes students make when hunting for a job is adopting a ¡¥scattergun¡¦ approach, such as sending out hundreds of the same covering letter to employers. A more effective way to land a job is to curate your covering letter, making it bespoke to the job spec and company ¡V and, yes, this is yet another way to engage.¡¨Speak with university staff and alumni¡§Most university tutors are more than happy to help students. We have a lot of leads, and can connect students to businesspeople on LinkedIn, send an email to a CEO we know, or provide entrepreneurial support or directions.¡¨It doesn¡¦t matter if you¡¦re still undecided about which career to pursue¡§Some students know their passion and, of course, should absolutely pursue that. But many have no idea what to do after graduation, which is no problem either.¡§I always encourage people to read Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein. It¡¦s about keeping your opportunities open for as long as possible ¡V one example cited by Epstein is Roger Federer, who dabbled in a variety of sports including skiing and wrestling, before deciding on tennis. When you¡¦re 20, you still have a chance to become a doctor, an engineer or pilot, or indeed launch your own business.If you end up leaving university and being an assistant to a florist, it could be great ¡V you could learn new skills, develop a passion for horticulture, or find a brilliant business idea. So many entrepreneurs started this way. Remember: hyper-specialisation is a thing of the past. These days, skills such as being creative and being able to navigate the gig economy may prove much more valuable than getting into a specific career.¡¨',\n",
              " 'For Josh Lewsey, winning at sport is comparatively simple. It¡¦s winning at business that¡¦s more of a challenge. ¡§When you work in a sports environment the currency of performance is pretty straightforward. You compete on tries, goals or such like in order to win or lose.¡¨However, ¡§businesses are more complex, multidimensional environments with many factors and potentially different agendas that may have differing opinions of what constitutes performance and success¡¨. Therefore trying to succeed at business can be a bit like ¡§playing a game on a pitch that changes shape¡¨.Lewsey may be one of the few people truly qualified to make this comparison.His name and face will already be familiar to rugby union fans from his days as a Wasp and a member of England¡¦s winning World Cup team in 2003. Less well-known, but no less impressive, is his success off the field. By 2009, when he quit professional rugby and joined PwC as a management consultant, he¡¦d already graduated from Bristol University, completed a postgraduate diploma in law and been commissioned as a British army officer. Also an INSEAD business school alumnus and possessing an executive MBA from Imperial College London, he¡¦s now located in Hong Kong. After almost five years as a strategy and transactions partner with EY-Parthenon, he¡¦s recently been appointed CEO of Teneo Value+ in Asia-Pacific and also professor of leadership at The University of Law Business School.It might seem incongruous to have had two seemingly contrasting careers but, in fact, Lewsey sees his past as being in the pursuit of a single goal: ¡§I now see there¡¦s been just one spine through my life. From competing against my brothers, to playing sports, being in the military and then business ¡V it¡¦s the idea of ¡¥leading performance¡¦.¡¨Rather than being completely different worlds, he feels that leadership in sport, the military and business exists on a ¡§fluid spectrum¡¨, and whilst having differing languages and currency of performance, he draws on these experiences and considers the mindset similar.¡§I¡¦ve been around some amazing and, indeed, some rather ineffective leaders in my life ¡V in some successful environments and some unsuccessful ones. It¡¦s all about learning from those ups and downs, so you can take an organisation, formulate a coherent strategy and then execute effectively.¡¨His current role at Teneo Value+ involves working with private capital investors and company CEOs to create value by identifying opportunities, financially quantifying these and executing against them. While opportunities differ for each client, he finds the problem in optimising value often lies in misalignment or a lack of multidisciplinary skills.¡§Many business schools develop people for finance, operations or other such technical verticals but when you get to be a CEO, the skills you require all come together. I see many CVs where graduates are super bright, with amazing technical skills in one dimension, but they often lack the ability to apply a holistic lens to problem solving, or aren¡¦t able to see a company from a rounded perspective,¡¨ says Lewsey.That¡¦s where his work with The University of Law comes in. He hopes his role will help students understand the need for a cross-disciplinary approach earlier in their careers. ¡§The University of Law is in a unique place because it has corporate governance at the heart of what it does, which pulls together a range of skills ¡V leadership, strategy and financial performance for example ¡V that are only usually brought together in the position of the CEO. So making sure the university builds its criteria and curriculum to develop this is really important, not just in terms of optimising a company¡¦s short-term performance but also in factoring in governance for longer-term value creation.¡¨Lewsey, whose mother was a teacher and whose father came from an agricultural background, feels fortunate that he¡¦s been able to channel his talents into the competitive world of global finance. ¡§A grammar school boy, I had no clue when I left school,¡¨ he says. It was his professional rugby career that freed him up to study subjects that interested him. ¡§You only play 80 minutes of rugby a week, so the rest of the time you can play PlayStation, or you can do other things,¡¨ he says. ¡§I always enjoyed learning although there wasn¡¦t an end stage in my mind at that time.¡¨As he¡¦d gone to the University of Bristol on a military bursary, in the first few years as a graduate this extra time was focused on his army training and then a two-year military commission. Later, it included establishing a leadership development company and capital markets investing as well as the further education that led him to find a passion in organisational performance.Having discovered his niche, he¡¦s particularly excited to be shaping tomorrow¡¦s business leaders. ¡§In the future, the what and the why may stay the same, but the how is changing: through digitisation, working from home and different ways of working. As this evolves, it¡¦s important that the leaders of tomorrow have rounded skill sets so they can lead across cultures, geographies, languages, jurisdictions ¡V motivating disparate individuals to a common aim.¡¨The leaders of the future will be able to take inspiration from Lewsey¡¦s story ¡V one of hard work and perseverance. His advice for the next generation: ¡§Be long-term, rather than short-term, greedy. There¡¦s no fast-track to being as good as you can be, but you¡¦ll get there eventually if you work hard enough.¡¨',\n",
              " 'If the pandemic has proved anything, it¡¦s that the essence of what it means to be a good leader is changing. Donald Trump might not like it, but the alpha, chest-bumping style of management seems to be leaving the building. In its place is a softer, more empathetic type of leadership, defined by honesty and clear communication styles.Its appeal has increased over the past two years ¡V think the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern showing compassion and providing clear communication or Gareth Southgate demonstrating humility and emotional intelligence. And not forgetting the myriad managers across the globe who have continually checked in on their staff during the pandemic.These are all attributes that students and graduates could be fine-tuning right now. Jim Moser, director of professional development at The University of Law explains how.Become a compassionate CEO¡§Businesses are increasingly adopting softer, empathetic styles of leadership that seek to answer the concerns of employees and the public. Covid has accelerated this. But it¡¦s not just a matter of appearing to be kind; you¡¦ve actually got to care, which can be challenging for some bosses.¡¨Leaders are accountable like never before¡§Another byproduct of Covid is the great resignation, where people have reflected on their jobs and sought to change them millions worldwide are quitting; in the UK, a quarter of workers plan to change jobs in the next few months, according to a survey by the recruitment company Randstad UK. Because of this, bosses can¡¦t force people to go back to the office, because employees will simply leave and go somewhere that offers them the flexible working they¡¦re after.¡§Today, people have a different relationship with their bosses than 50 years ago. There¡¦s less deference, and while bosses have always kept an eye on staff, the advent of the internet and social media means leaders are under scrutiny from employees, too.¡§What does this all mean? Well, not only do today¡¦s leaders need to ensure the wellbeing of their staff, but they also need to invest more trust in them. The idea that workers can only be productive when a boss is watching over their shoulders has gone.¡¨Be an advocate for causes you feel strongly about¡§The more progressive organisations are increasingly giving a forum to workers to advocate issues and topics they feel strongly about ¡V such as LGBTQ+ rights. Think what the important issues likely to affect your sector in years to come might be. Is there anything people in your organisation need training in, such as greater diversity and inclusion? If you take a stance, it could play well for your future career.¡¨Own up to your mistakes¡§Leaders should lead by example. Be honest about your mistakes. If you¡¦ve messed something up, people will respect you more for saying so, rather than not. As a leader, you must set a culture where people confess to their failures and learn from them.¡¨Throw compliments around like confetti ¡§Today, people expect to receive feedback. So, if somebody has completed some good work, tell them about it. It¡¦s one of the best ways to ensure your team is enthusiastic and productive.¡¨Don¡¦t be mates with your staff¡§Think about what a friendship with your staff would do to your role. Will you treat other staff less favourably because they¡¦re not your friends? Will you be able to judge things correctly if your friend commits an error? Friendships make leaders¡¦ jobs more difficult ¡V you need to be able to differentiate.¡¨Be an inclusive leader¡§Surround yourself with people from different backgrounds. Recruiting people on the same path is a hopeless hiring strategy, and will stop you from reaping the benefits of having fresh ideas coming from different sources.¡§Businesses of the future will need a mixture of people: graduates from different disciplines, non-graduates, creative workers, entrepreneurial people and analytic staff. It will be difficult for any business to survive without these people.¡¨Ensure there¡¦s a sense of yin and yang between you and your deputy¡§Leaders should examine their own insecurities. If you know you¡¦re not particularly creative, you should accept that and consider employing others who can deal with the creative aspects of the business.Look at Richard Branson ¡V he¡¦s an amiable, driven personality, but has always hired more conventional business types because they complemented his other skills. Likewise, you¡¦ll often find advertising businesses with a CEO who¡¦s good with the financial side of things, but surrounds themselves with creatives who really influence what¡¦s going on.¡¨Don¡¦t neglect the other factors needed for success¡§The leaders that get to the top achieve it because they¡¦ve got dedication, have a strong work ethic and are good at what they do. Don¡¦t forget that luck can also play a role, but it¡¦ll be your ability, hard work and honesty that will enable you to reflect and make good decisions, and ultimately make you a good leader.¡¨',\n",

              " 'With Christmas just around the corner, the opportunity to celebrate and reunite with loved ones after a difficult year is almost upon us. But Covid-19 still poses a very real threat because of the new Omicron variant and the increase in social interactions anticipated over the coming weeks.Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid-19 booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk/covidvaccination.¡§Get boosted now¡¨ is the best way to protect ourselves against Omicron. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before with Covid-19 because Omicron Covid-19 is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves.You can get a Covid-19 booster 12 weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should significantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.With cases of Covid-19 rising, new measures have been implemented ¡V such as face coverings becoming mandatory for some indoor public venues, including places of worship, theatres and cinemas, as well as in shops and on public transport. People have also been advised to resume working from home where possible, while access to certain venues, including nightclubs, requires Covid certification (or negative rapid lateral flow test).Despite stricter new rules, it¡¦s still crucial we continue to follow other safety measures over the holidays to protect ourselves and loved ones, says GP partner Dr Luke Gardner, from the Park Surgery, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. ¡§This Christmas, I will be spending the day with a few members of my close family,¡¨ he says. ¡§As far as gift buying goes, I¡¦m popping into local shops at less busy times, maintaining social distancing, wearing a face mask and ensuring I¡¦ve packed my hand sanitiser.¡¨Thinking about plans beforehand can be helpful, he says. ¡§The risk of viral transmission is reduced when meeting people outside, therefore my gift exchanges this year with friends will be completed outside over a glass of mulled wine or hot chocolate, rather than in my home.¡¨Ahead of the big day itself, testing is still incredibly important, adds Gardner. ¡§Leading up to Christmas Day, all members of my family will be taking a rapid lateral flow test before meeting, since these give an extra layer of security alongside following all of the other advice.¡§For our Christmas Day meal, we plan to eat in the largest room in the house to maximise ventilation. The kitchen extractor fan will be whizzing away all day and the windows will be open to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of virus transmission. If anyone in the family feels unwell with symptoms of Covid-19 ¡V anything from a high temperature or new cough to loss of taste or smell ¡V then they will take a PCR test and isolate appropriately until their test results are back. As we enjoy the festive period, it¡¦s really important that we all follow NHS and public health advice this year to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our communities safe.¡¨Take up vaccine boosters We know that the vaccine is our best defence against the virus, reducing our chances of spreading and catching it, and ¡V if we become infected ¡V it means we are less likely to become seriously ill as a result. It¡¦s vital to stay on top of booster vaccinations, hence the UK-wide drive, so be sure to prioritise getting one when you are invited to or when your age group becomes eligible. If you haven¡¦t had your primary dose yet, do so as soon as you can (you can book by calling your GP or visiting the NHS website).Now is a good time to start thinking about other jabs and boosters as well. More people are expected to get flu this winter as fewer people will have built up natural immunity as a result of social distancing measures during the pandemic. Research shows that anybody who gets flu and Covid-19 at the same time is more likely to become seriously ill, so it¡¦s really important to protect yourself and those around you by having any vaccinations offered. Even if you have already had Covid-19, the flu vaccine is still safe and effective at helping to prevent flu.Keep indoor areas well-ventilated Because the Covid-19 virus is passed on via droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, talks or breathes, meeting outdoors dramatically reduces the risk of airborne transmission. Sometimes though, this isn¡¦t always possible, so when in close contact with others indoors, it¡¦s important to let fresh air in whenever you can.Research shows that the more fresh air we let into our homes or enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles, so by ventilating indoor spaces we are able to dramatically reduce the chances of transmission. Even just opening windows for 10 minutes makes a real difference. Extractor fans in the bathroom or kitchen are another helpful way of letting fresh air in (just leave them running for longer than usual, with the door closed).Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering at Leeds University, says: ¡§While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it¡¦s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home, even when people are vaccinated.¡¨She explains: ¡§In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especially if there is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air. That¡¦s why it¡¦s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, even if just regularly for a short time. This way, fresh air can disperse and blow Covid-19 particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.¡¨Wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed areas New government rules mean face coverings are now mandatory in some indoor public venues, including places of worship, theatres and cinemas, as well as in communal areas of universities, colleges and schools (by staff, visitors and pupils in year 7 or above) and on public transport.Ensuring we protect ourselves and those around us is key, so make sure your mask or face covering fits properly ¡V they should cover the nose and mouth completely while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Evidence suggests thicker fabrics and multiple layers may reduce the risk of transmission, so ideally they will be made from at least two layers of material in order to work effectively (the World Health Organization recommends three layers).Getting in the habit of wearing them in situations where we might be at a higher risk of catching or transmitting the virus is incredibly important ¡V even if it¡¦s not legally required. It¡¦s especially important to remain vigilant in crowded or enclosed spaces, since it¡¦s not always obvious if somebody is infected.Remain vigilant about testing When life is busy, it¡¦s easy to forget to take a test, or to check others in the household are doing so regularly. But ensuring we take regular rapid tests will deliver peace of mind when meeting loved ones over the holidays, as well as helping to stop the spread of the virus. Ahead of meeting anybody indoors or visiting those who are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if infected, be sure to take a rapid lateral flow test. Use existing supplies ¡V many schools and workplaces offer free tests, as well as some pharmacies, local community test sites or the NHS website ¡V it¡¦s worth thinking ahead when it comes to the holidays, when we¡¦re likely to be socialising much more.Don¡¦t forget the NHS Covid-19 app is still the fastest way to know if you¡¦ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid-19, so keep it on.If results are positive, ensure you self-isolate immediately and take a PCR test, as well as reporting the test results (at gov.uk/report-covid19-result or by calling 119). This is important, since it helps the NHS monitor the spread of the virus and ultimately, saves lives.For those travelling this Christmas, new rules now mean anybody aged 12 or over travelling to England from abroad must show a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test result beforehand, having taken the test in the two days ahead of travel. You must also take a PCR test within two days of arriving, self-isolating until the negative test result has been delivered (even if fully vaccinated).Daily testing for contacts of Covid-19From Tuesday, 14 December 2021, if you have been in contact with someone with Covid-19 and are double-vaccinated you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven days if you have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that day if you test negative. This applies to those who have been contact traced officially and those who have found out in any other way. All those who test positive within the seven days or develop symptoms must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the latest guidance on gov.uk.Remember, if you develop Covid-19 symptoms at any time, you must self-isolate and take a PCR test. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for 10 days if you are a contact of someone with Covid-19. Those working in a vulnerable setting already have access to daily contact testing and should continue to follow the specific guidance from their workplace as this varies depending on the setting.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

              " 'Unemployment can often deliver a blow to confidence, creating growing self-doubt in the face of mounting bills or a stream of automated rejection letters.When Diane Hall, who is in her 50s and lives in Walsall, in the West Midlands, had her first meeting with her local training provider, Embark Learning, last autumn, her self-esteem had been battered. Business development manager Safwan Hanash remembers: ¡§She was nervous, and wanted to pull the plug, saying: ¡¥I can¡¦t do it, I can¡¦t do it.¡¦¡¨Yet, just three months on, Hall has attained her first qualifications since leaving school, has breezed through a job interview, and now works in a care home, helping keep residents safe during Covid-19. It¡¦s a new career path for somebody who had long assumed such avenues were closed to her. As Hanash recalls: ¡§All Diane wanted was to give something back and to just work. The transformation has been phenomenal.¡¨Hall is one of many people to have secured a job through the UK government¡¦s Sector based Work Academy Programme (SWAP), which has helped more than 40,000 people into work-experience placements. The scheme, part of the 280bn Plan for Jobs package to spur economic recovery from Covid-19, gives jobseekers receiving unemployment benefits a chance to experience work in industries such as care, construction or logistics. Along the way, candidates receive free training, spring-clean their CVs, and learn how to master job interviews.The scheme that Hall and Hanash were involved in was particularly successful. All those who started training at Embark Learning last October have been give jobs with Fairway Homecare, a care provider across the West Midlands.¡§The beauty of the scheme is that candidates don¡¦t need experience,¡¨ says Hanash. ¡§If they¡¦d applied for jobs with other care providers, they¡¦d have been asked about their credentials and experience, meaning they¡¦d probably have struggled to get a response, let alone an interview.¡¨As such, SWAP can benefit those lacking qualifications (such as Hall) or those wishing to pivot to a new career. Embark Learning has been deluged with applications from people made redundant in Covid-hit sectors such as hospitality and retail. But its talent pool also includes former social-care workers returning after raising families and graduates wanting to pursue a career in mental health.¡§For many, though, it¡¦s about survival and putting food on the table.¡¨ says Hanash. ¡§I know what that feels like: I¡¦ve been poor, struggled financially and applied for opportunities where nobody¡¦s given me the time of day ... But SWAP raises people¡¦s self-esteem and gives them stability. That transformation is what motivates me.¡¨The programme has resonated with under-25s, the generation whose employment prospects have been hit hardest by the pandemic. ¡§You might assume young people would be fazed by the idea of washing residents. But, once they start the scheme, they rarely drop out,¡¨ says Hanash.Candidates receive training by Embark Learning in partnership with local colleges. It¡¦s at this stage that jobseekers lacking confidence ¡V such as those who believe recruiters will regard them as being over-the-hill ¡V often rediscover long forgotten talents.¡§Some candidates are in their early 60s, and tell me they haven¡¦t got experience or they¡¦re too old,¡¨ says Hanash. ¡§This couldn¡¦t be further from the truth. If they¡¦ve cared for their children or family, they¡¦ve got valuable experience. When I ask whether they¡¦ve ever changed nappies or administered medicine for a loved one, they start to think: ¡¥Oh, I have got skills.¡¦¡¨During pre-employment training ¡V which can be tailored to the needs of the business sector in which the candidate will work ¡V trainees develop the skills they¡¦ll need in the workplace, gain qualifications and learn how to deal with job interviews. There¡¦s also an option of free clothing for those unable to afford suits or other work attire.The next stage is the work placement, where candidates acquire hands-on experience. According to Hanash, the ritual of turning up to work every day ¡§establishes normality and stability after years of not having a routine¡¨. He believes the scheme is having a positive impact on wellbeing and mental health.As well as transforming the chances of those seeking work, the scheme benefits employers, too. Aside from providing trained recruits, it improves company culture by boosting staff diversity and social mobility. It is also an effective way to upskill other staff, who can develop leadership skills by mentoring or supervising the new charges. At a time when staff numbers in care homes risk being depleted when workers self-isolate, the extra help from SWAP candidates can be invaluable.There¡¦s no cost to the business because the UK government funds placements. As for candidates, they continue to receive benefits during a placement and have travel and childcare costs paid.Of course, not every candidate will secure a full-time job at the end of the four-week scheme. Even so, Hanash points out that their time will not have been wasted. ¡§They¡¦ll have gained knowledge, skills, certificates and an updated CV to make themselves more marketable,¡¨ he says. ¡§I¡¦d be more inclined to employ somebody with a recent qualification, rather than somebody who¡¦s done nothing.¡¨Some of the schemes that are part of the Plan for Jobs portfolioSECTOR-BASED WORK ACADEMY PROGRAMME (SWAP)Who it helpsA six-week scheme pairing businesses that want to hire skilled workers with unemployed people looking for jobs.How it worksPrior to the placement, the candidates receive training delivered by local colleges or training providers. This is paid for by the UK government, and can be tailored to the business or sector where the candidates will undertake their placements.After completing their training, the candidates will start their SWAP work-experience placements. They will still receive benefits while on the placement, plus travel and childcare costs.Why do itSWAP is aimed at people who are receiving unemployment benefits. They may have been out of work for some time or could have recently lost their jobs due to Covid-19. It offers an opportunity to learn new skills and gives them the experience of working in a new industry, without having to spend money on retraining.For businesses, the scheme could introduce them to people they¡¦d like to employ full-time, or it could help them identify future talent for apprenticeships. The placements can also be a way to upskill existing staff, by providing opportunities for them to mentor and supervise SWAP candidates.There is no direct cost to the business; all SWAP placements are UK government-funded.More informationgov.uk/jobhelp Employer services line: 0800 169 0178KICKSTARTWho it helpsThis programme is for young people (16-24 year olds) claiming universal credit who are at risk of long-term unemployment because of the disruption caused by Covid-19. The 2bn Kickstart Scheme allows them to undertake a six-month job placement to help develop the skills needed to find work, but it could also lead to full-time employment. Businesses such as Domino¡¦s Pizza, Tesco and Network Rail have all signed up.How it worksDuring their placements, candidates will spend all their time in the workplace, where they¡¦ll gain work experience and training to boost their chances of being hired afterwards.All wages are fully funded by the UK government at the national minimum wage for up to 25 hours a week. National insurance and automatic-enrolment pension contributions are also subsidised. Employers can provide wage top-ups if they wish.Why do itIt¡¦s a long-term investment for businesses: the Kickstart candidate could end up working full-time for a company or take up an apprenticeship with it.Kickstart could also be used for the personal development of existing staff members, who can upskill by supervising, mentoring or coaching the candidates.More informationkickstart.campaign.gov.ukNEW ENTERPRISE ALLOWANCE (NEA)Who it helpsUnemployed people or those receiving benefits who are thinking of starting their own business. Self-employed people who want to expand their businesses can also use the scheme.The NEA provides financial assistance to support people¡¦s entrepreneurial ambitions. Since it launched in 2011, it has enabled more than 215,000 jobseekers to become their own bosses.How it worksThe candidates will need to put together a business plan that has to be approved by a Jobcentre Plus work coach.Successful candidates may receive a weekly allowance of up to 1,274 over 26 weeks; and be assigned a mentor who will give advice for up to 12 months. Candidates can also apply for a loan to help with startup costs.Why do itIt gives people the chance to move away from benefits and set up their own business. The loans are UK government-backed and there are no fees for applying or for repaying them early.Candidates can receive free advice from a mentor.More informationTalk to your Jobcentre Plus work coach, who can check your business idea and eligibility.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

              " 'There¡¦s no denying that weddings are joyful, but they also come freighted with a list of unwritten rules, which guests should obey but often breach.Of course, during the pandemic, weddings and other significant life events, from civil partnerships to funerals, baptisms, barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs, have been governed by another, tougher but necessary, set of guidelines: downsized guest numbers, hand sanitisation after exchanging rings, fathers walking their daughters down the aisle 1 metre apart.The good news is that last Monday (21 June) in England, many of these rules were relaxed. The advice that only 30 people could attend an event has been be lifted; the final headcount now depends on how many people the venue can safely accommodate. Meanwhile, weddings, wakes and other gatherings can be held in gardens, barns and on private land. Hen and stag parties can also take place.However, with the Delta variant of the virus still spreading in the UK, there are a few additional rules to ensure everybody is kept safe. These range from increased air ventilation for marquees to conducting a risk assessment ¡V don¡¦t worry guests, this won¡¦t be your responsibility. All the usual advice on social distancing and hygiene, such as hand washing, remains the same.Getting together with loved ones is something many of us have craved over the past 16 months. Whether you¡¦re celebrating as a happy couple ties the knot or saying goodbye to a dear old friend, here¡¦s how to do it in the safest manner possible ...Can brides and grooms still have the big wedding that they¡¦d always planned?Yes, but only if their venue can safely accommodate the guests. The 30-person cap on weddings and civil partnerships was lifted on 21 June, but venues will still need to do some maths, calculating how many people their space can hold in accordance with social distancing measures. This also applies to funerals and wakes.If the event is being staged in a Covid-secure venue, such as a hotel, restaurant, church, mosque, temple or synagogue, then this venue should already be taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The event¡¦s organisers should contact the venue manager beforehand to see how many guests can safely attend.Do I need to wear my face mask if I¡¦m a guest at a wedding?The rules apply just as if you¡¦re travelling on a train or shopping in a supermarket. Your face covering should be worn during both the ceremony and reception, except when you¡¦re eating and drinking. The only people exempt are the newlyweds, the person officiating at the service and those with medical conditions. If you¡¦re attending an outdoor wedding, there¡¦s no legal requirement to wear a mask, but you may wish to do so for your own safety.What happens if I¡¦m attending a wedding or wake somewhere that isn¡¦t Covid-secure, such as a private home?If a wedding or wake is being held inside a private home or another enclosed space, then the guestlist will be limited to either six people or two households. However, if it¡¦s a ¡§deathbed¡¨ wedding ceremony, where one partner is terminally ill, this can be increased to 30 people.Do outdoor weddings or wakes need to adhere to these rules too?If a wedding or wake is taking place in the garden of a private home, a field, beach, or any other outdoor space, there¡¦s no cap on guest numbers. However, if more than 30 people are attending, a risk assessment (see below) will need to be carried out. Social distancing measures for outside space will still apply.The popularity of marquees at weddings throws up a conundrum: are they indoor or outdoor venues? It all comes down to the ¡§walls¡¨ of the marquee: if two sides of the canvas are removed or rolled up, the increased ventilation this brings means that a marquee-based reception will count as being ¡§outdoors¡¨.The words ¡¥risk assessment¡¦ were mentioned. What does this involve and how onerous is it?If the event takes place somewhere used for commercial or hospitality purposes, such as a hotel or restaurant, then the venue itself should have carried out a risk assessment beforehand. However, if the ceremony and reception are being hosted somewhere that isn¡¦t Covid-secure, such as a private garden or barn, then the organiser should carry out the risk assessment themselves.It¡¦s a simple evaluation that starts with the organiser noting down any risks on a document. For example, do you have any vulnerable guests? The next step is to identify and implement the best actions to minimise the risk of transmission between guests, such as establishing more routes to the bathroom, increasing ventilation in the venue, or installing more hand-sanitisation areas.If the wedding involves outside suppliers such as caterers, they¡¦ll also need to complete a risk assessment and share it with the organiser.Failure to conduct a risk assessment could result in a 10,000 fine.There are few things I love more at a wedding than a good old boogie. Can I still showcase my moves?Sadly, dancing isn¡¦t advised because of the increased risk of transmission. Dancefloors will remain closed, with many venues likely to repurpose them for additional seating space. There is, of course, one exception: brides and grooms will be able to have their first dance together, meaning they can shimmy, samba, jitterbug or foxtrot away to their hearts¡¦ content.My friends have booked a band for their wedding. Will it still be able to perform?Yes, but any bands or choirs must be limited to six members indoors. Meanwhile, because singing increases the risk of airborne transmission of Covid-19 through aerosol particles and small droplets, guests are advised not to join in singing with bands or choirs.How are other nuptial traditions affected by the new guidance?Wedding speeches should either be conducted outside or by using a PA system, so that the speaker doesn¡¦t need to shout or project their voice.Cutting the cake and playing games can still take place, but guests will need to exercise the same precautions as they would in any public place, such as wearing face coverings.Guest books, photo booths, shared orders of service and games are permitted. However, because a number of people are likely to end up touching these objects, their usage should be minimised and hand sanitisation encouraged.As for wedding meals, it¡¦s table service only, with no buffets allowed.The UK Alliance of Wedding Planners has suggested some Covid-safe ideas for weddings, such as traditional games, quiz nights, stand-up comics and outdoor sports.What about hen or stag dos?These can still take place. However, if taking place indoors, the numbers attending these prenuptial shindigs are capped at six people, or two households. Outdoors, no more than 30 merrymakers can attend.Do the wedding rules apply to other events?The numbers attending funerals and other commemorative events, such as stone settings and ash scatterings, are no longer curbed at 30 people. This extends to wakes too. However, cash charity donations are discouraged: online platforms such as JustGiving are a better idea.What happens if I don¡¦t obey the rules above?If you arrange a gathering but ignore these latest rules you could face a 10,000 fine. If a couple fails to do proper risk assessment on their ceremony, then they could be hit with this 10,000 penalty too.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

              " 'Following the news that schools and colleges will reopen, with Covid-19 testing measures in place, to all pupils ¡V apart from those who are clinically extremely vulnerable ¡V from 8 March, Enass Al-Ani, the principal at Small Heath leadership academy in Birmingham, felt an enormous surge of relief. ¡§The announcement that schools will reopen fully is great news,¡¨ she says. ¡§It¡¦s absolutely vital that children get the whole school experience. Nothing can replace that direct face-to-face teaching. The students have missed so much: not seeing their friends; not engaging with all the things we do here, day in, day out; interactions with teachers; time in the playground; extracurricular activities. I¡¦m so thankful and proud of the staff here for the fantastic work they¡¦ve done, but remote teaching cannot substitute the complete experience students receive in school.¡¨Al-Ani, who has been principal at Small Heath leadership academy since 2017, reels off a list of school clubs that have, understandably, remained closed ¡V from the RAF cadet programme to archery and drama club with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. ¡§We have very broad and wide-ranging activities taking place every single day normally,¡¨ she says. ¡§These things just cannot be replicated online and that¡¦s what the students have been missing out on during lockdown.¡¨ But teachers and support staff have had their work cut out, working across both online platforms and in person. ¡§As part of Star Academies trust, we¡¦ve worked with other Star Academies schools in Birmingham to create a hub, which remained open throughout lockdown, including bank holidays and Easter, for vulnerable students and children of key workers.¡¨The last year has been difficult for both staff and pupils, says Al-Ani. ¡§Covid-19 has been a challenge for everyone and the main issue for us has been ensuring we provide students with the education they deserve.¡¨Thankfully, staff have been able to communicate closely with pupils over the past year. ¡§In the first lockdown, our form tutors contacted every student in their form on a weekly basis, with pastoral leaders ¡V our heads of year ¡V speaking to every student weekly, too. It meant every child received two weekly calls to check on their wellbeing and progress. During this lockdown, pastoral leaders contacted students every week, too. So we know our families and students really well.¡§My role as the principal ¡V along with my senior leadership team ¡V means ensuring we are there for staff, students and parents, that¡¦s very important. Staff can always contact me at any time in the day or evening. Whenever they need me, I¡¦m on email and have my phone ready.¡¨Al-Ani is aware of the impact lockdown has had on students¡¦ mental health and thinks it should be prioritised. ¡§School closures and the lockdown have taken their toll on young people¡¦s mental health and wellbeing,¡¨ she says. ¡§We regularly do surveys with our students, to see how we can support them better. One of the most popular responses in terms of how we can improve was: ¡¥Open the school fully, we want to come back!¡¦ They¡¦re so excited to be back.¡¨It means supporting students emotionally over the coming weeks will be crucial. ¡§We know children are incredibly resilient and bounce back, but schools have an important role to play in ensuring the pandemic doesn¡¦t have long-term repercussions on young people¡¦s mental wellbeing. When students return, our initial focus will be on their wellbeing and we¡¦ll continue to provide extra support for the foreseeable future. We want children to come back and be happy about it. We want them to reintegrate into the school community and re-establish friendships. We¡¦ll support this by focusing on providing trust and support first and, once they¡¦ve settled in, we will ensure any gaps in learning are addressed.¡¨While relaxing restrictions on any sector of society will involve some risk, schools already have stringent measures in place that make it as safe as possible to fully reopen. ¡§Well, this isn¡¦t the first time, is it?¡¨ Al-Ani points out. ¡§We¡¦ve learned a great deal and have developed a comprehensive and robust reopening plan. Absolutely everything is planned for. When we fully reopen, we¡¦ll continue to play our part in keeping our community safe.¡¨Having already purchased face coverings for staff and students well before the lockdown, strict guidelines are in place around social distancing, hand sanitising (there are stations outside every classroom) and handwashing (sinks have also been placed around the academy), with posters and videos demonstrating techniques. ¡§We¡¦re also very blessed at the academy as we¡¦re able to have five different exit and entrance points,¡¨ she says. ¡§So each year group arrives and leaves through a different entrance, which means we don¡¦t have to stagger the start and the end of the day and bubbles won¡¦t interact with each other.¡¨Regular testing forms a key part of the new safety measures, with lateral flow devices (LFD) ¡V which turn around results in about 30 minutes ¡V used to test potentially asymptomatic staff and pupils in schools, before they are given twice-weekly tests to carry out at home. Many staff and pupils at Small Heath leadership academy are already familiar with the testing procedure, she says. ¡§We were lucky to be part of the pilot for the LFD tests in the autumn, so the testing is nothing new to us. It enabled us to learn and put measures in place to reassure students, parents and staff. They¡¦re really simple and don¡¦t hurt, so we hope the process gives everyone reassurance and that everyone takes part.¡¨She feels confident about the response from pupils in particular. ¡§When we came back in September after the first lockdown, I was worried about how students and staff would react to new protective measures. But I shouldn¡¦t have worried ¡V they were absolutely brilliant. They accepted the new measures that had been put in place straight away, and it became part of our ¡V I hate to say it ¡V new normal.¡¨As well as taking the necessary steps to protect staff and pupils¡¦ health, Al-Ani and the senior leadership team are focusing on boosting the school¡¦s mood, too. ¡§It¡¦s been nearly a year for many students away from school, so we¡¦re doing a lot around their return, to uplift students¡¦ and staff morale. We¡¦re planning extra assemblies and rewards for students, with posters welcoming them back. And activities with staff to celebrate their contributions, as well as team-building exercises. We¡¦re planning a fun element as part of our programme.¡¨How does she feel knowing that in a matter of days all pupils and teachers will finally be reunited? ¡§I¡¦m so excited. I¡¦ve missed this buzz around the school, I really have. While we¡¦ve had staff in, to have the whole cohort of staff and students in the building, that¡¦s what I¡¦m used to. I¡¦m used to seeing them here and working alongside them.

              " 'How can the vaccines be safe when they¡¦ve been developed so quickly?¡§This is by far the biggest concern expressed by my patients,¡¨ says Dr Farzana Hussain, who has a GP surgery in east London. ¡§Covid-19 is a serious global pandemic, so more scientists have worked on the vaccine with greater financial investment. Also, Covid-19 vaccine trials involved the same rigorous testing.¡¨What about potential long-term side effects?Generally speaking, the side-effects of other vaccines usually occur within a week or so of receiving the jab, rather than months or years later. ¡§If you develop side effects it demonstrates your immune system is responding to the vaccine,¡¨ says Hussain. ¡§It¡¦s about weighing up risks and benefits,¡¨ she says. ¡§Not taking the vaccine could leave you more at risk of getting Covid-19, and becoming seriously ill with it.¡¨How effective are the vaccines?The most recent study on the effect of vaccines from Public Health England (PHE) shows that vaccines provide a high level of protection ¡V they decrease your risk of catching Covid-19, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment as well as the number of people who die from Covid-19.Can the two doses be mixed and matched?¡§Because the trials were done using the same vaccine, we¡¦re asking people to have their second dose using the same brand,¡¨ says Hussain. A 7m trial was recently launched to examine whether combining jabs could provide better protection.Having your second dose is really important when the time comes. The first dose of the vaccine provides a high level of protection, but for that protection to last longer, everyone needs to get a second dose.Are the vaccines safe for those with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or asthma?Yes, says Hussain, who notes the vaccines have been stringently tested on those with underlying illnesses. ¡§It¡¦s important that people with long-term health conditions receive the vaccine because they¡¦re often more at risk of getting Covid-19,¡¨ she says.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had previously advised against anyone with a history of anaphylaxis ¡V a life-threatening reaction caused by allergens ¡V getting the vaccine. However, it has since revised its guidelines to reflect that the vaccine is mostly safe for people who have been affected by anaphylaxis, except those individuals who have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients or if they experience anaphylaxis after the first dose. The MHRA¡¦s current guidance is based on detailed analysis of data up to 7 February 2021. At this date, an estimated 7.5m first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 5m doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered, and around 500,000 second doses, mostly the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, had been administered.Can I have the vaccine if I am taking other medicines?Most medicines will not be a problem if taken alongside the Covid vaccine, but anyone in doubt should check with their GP. Patients who are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin, apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran can receive the vaccine, provided their treatment is stable and they do not have unexplained bruising or bleeding.Are the Covid-19 vaccines safe for people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities?Yes, the vaccines are safe. Hussain says she¡¦s encountered vaccine hesitancy from some patients. ¡§It¡¦s for a variety of reasons, ranging from a historical mistrust of authorities to concerns about animal products,¡¨ she says.¡§However, Covid-19 death rates are highest among BAME groups people in BAME groups have a 10-50% higher risk of Covid-19 mortality compared with white British people, according to a Public Health England review, and the vaccine can save their life. Also, many thousands of BAME people were involved in the trials.¡¨Is the vaccine halal?¡§I have South Asian patients worried about the vaccines containing animal products, but there are none in there,¡¨ says Hussain. She also notes that both the Muslim Council of Britain and the British Islamic Medical Association endorse the vaccine.What is the most common myth you encounter about the vaccine?¡§That the vaccine could affect your fertility ¡V there is no evidence nor any reason why the vaccine could impact fertility,¡¨ says Dunkley-Bent.Can I still take the vaccine if I¡¦m breastfeeding?¡§Absolutely,¡¨ says Dunkley-Bent. ¡§We¡¦ve got no evidence of any risk of giving a non-live vaccine vaccine that doesn¡¦t contain the virus during breastfeeding. The health benefits of receiving the vaccine will far outweigh any risk.¡¨I am young and fit, so therefore less likely to die from Covid-19. Why should I get the jab?The vaccine is currently being offered to people in high priority groups, but will soon be available for young people. With this in mind, Hussain says: ¡§It¡¦s true younger people are less likely to die from Covid-19, but we¡¦re seeing more examples of long Covid in young people, a horrid illness that damages organs. Receiving the vaccine will protect you from that.¡¨More than half the UK¡¦s adult population has now been vaccinated. This achievement is testament to the efforts of the NHS and GPs around the country, but it is crucial that everyone gets a vaccine when their time comes.Are the Covid vaccines safe for children?Neither the Pfizer/BioNTech or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines are licensed for under-16-year-olds, says Hussain, because trials remain in progress. However, for a very small number of children at a higher risk of catching the virus and serious illness, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that vaccination can be appropriate, but that this should be a carefully discussed decision between parents/guardians and their GP.Do I still need to get the vaccine if I¡¦ve already had Covid-19?Yes. ¡§We really don¡¦t know how long immunity lasts after you¡¦ve been infected with Covid-19,¡¨ says Hussain, who also points out the rise of new variants. ¡§People who have been previously infected may still catch these variants, but it¡¦s believed the vaccines can offer some protection against them.¡¨How long am I immunised for after receiving the vaccine?¡§My feeling is it won¡¦t be a once-in-a-lifetime jab,¡¨ says Hussain. ¡§It could be a seasonal jab, like the annual booster flu injections.¡¨I¡¦ve got vaccine-sceptical family members. How can I persuade them to take the vaccine?¡§Remember: there¡¦s probably a very good reason for your family member being reluctant,¡¨ says Hussain. ¡§So, first of all ¡V and this is what I¡¦m doing with my patients ¡V listen to them. Try to explore their reasons. Also, get them to speak to another person, such as a friend or family member, who¡¦s had the jab. This makes it more real.¡¨If anybody needs more reassurance on the vaccine, Hussain suggests discussing these with your GP, practice nurse, or even your high-street chemist. ¡§Everybody ought to have questions during this scary time ¡V it¡¦s exactly what people like me are here for,¡¨ she says.Marsha McAdam is a mental health advocate living in Manchester. She hopes the vaccine will enable her to resume the volunteering work that helps her manage her borderline personality disorderThe footage of intensive care units (ICU) featuring PPE-clad staff lifting patients and machines bleeping eerily away were among the most harrowing scenes from the pandemic. For Marsha McAdam, it was terrifying, bringing back painful memories of being on an ICU unit herself for three weeks after taking a near-fatal overdose.Since her 2008 overdose, McAdam, who has borderline personality disorder, has managed her condition through mentalisation-based therapy and volunteering for the initiative Equally Well. But the horrors of the pandemic combined with shielding (McAdam has fibromyalgia and type 2 diabetes) has put her mental health at risk. ¡§If it wasn¡¦t for carers visiting twice a day, and my son, I wouldn¡¦t see anybody.¡¨The Covid-19 vaccine changes that. McAdam received her first dose in late-February (her 26-year-old carer son was also vaccinated), giving her confidence to visit central Manchester, something she hadn¡¦t done in months. ¡§I spent hours on my mobility scooter visiting shops within current guidelines.

              " 'The past year or so has seen the rise of fashion rental services ¡V with many people opting to rent their clothes rather than buy new items. At this year¡¦s catwalk shows, the fashion editors made a point of wearing rentals on the front row.Borrowing rather than buying offers a huge range of benefits, from saving money and wardrobe space to being more sustainable. And it makes even more sense to rent large pieces of furniture, such as sofas, that are expensive to purchase and difficult to move. Here are five reasons why you should rent your next sofa.1 Short-term solutionsHow long do you anticipate staying in your home? Whether you rent or own, if you think you might end up moving within the next year or so then you probably don¡¦t want to splash out on a big-ticket item such as a sofa.One that fits where you¡¦re currently living may not be suitable in a new place, so what do you do with it then? Even if you recoup some of the cost by selling it, that process can be a hassle. And there are only so many times you can ask your mates to help you carry the same bulky piece of furniture in and out of your flat.Renting can help you bypass these dilemmas. You get what works for your present circumstances without having to worry about long-term commitment or van sizes.Even if you¡¦re not planning to move any time soon, how we live can change. You may find yourself having to accommodate ageing parents, friends who need a roof over their heads for a couple of months, or boomerang children (and potentially their children, too). Renting an additional sofa or a couple of extra chairs can be the ideal stopgap solution.2 SpeedAnyone who has ever bought a sofa ¡V especially during the lockdowns ¡V will know that some places can take more than three months to deliver your new purchase.If you¡¦re moving house, for instance, being able to quickly make your new space feel like home can help you settle in sooner. Fortunately, furniture rental doesn¡¦t have long lead times. With schemes such as Loop from Sofology, free delivery in as little as two weeks means you can soon be sitting pretty.3 SimplicityThere¡¦s no need to spend hours of your weekend trudging around furniture showrooms, weighing up the pros and cons of different options. Loop gives you the flexibility to choose the colour of your sofa and the length of time you want to keep it for ¡V you can go for six, 12 or 18 months (with the option to extend).When you¡¦re not trying to figure out if you¡¦ll still love that distinctive fabric in 10 years¡¦ time, decision-making becomes much more straightforward.4 SafetyBuying secondhand has long been an easy, affordable and green way to furnish your home. In many cases, it¡¦s still a great route to take, especially if you¡¦re after an item that will only get better with age: a beautiful wooden dining table or a solid chest of drawers, for example.But a sofa? Wear and tear can lead to everything from worn-out upholstery to damaged springs, lumpy cushions and sagging seats. Alongside issues of comfort and quality, there are also safety considerations. Is that bargain listed on a local online marketplace really such great value if you can¡¦t be sure about its fire safety credentials? If you go for rental you avoid the risks.Loop allows you to enjoy a brand new sofa, with fabrics and fillings made from recyclable materials that can go on to be made into something else, so nothing goes to landfill when you¡¦re done and you won¡¦t have to worry about any potential safety issues.5 SustainabilityAccording to the North London Waste Authority, 22m items of damaged furniture go to landfill every year. Renting can change this.When your Loop rental comes to an end, Sofology will take the items away and recycle or repurpose every component. Thanks to the 25-year lifespan, the sofas¡¦ steel frames can be reused, while the cushions are 100% recyclable. Even the FSC-certified wooden arm frames and feet will have a new life.So do your bit to protect our planet, and don¡¦t let your next sofa go to waste.',\n",
              " 'We all have a responsibility to recycle as much as we can in our daily lives. Some of us have invested in reusable water bottles in a bid to do away with single-use plastics, while others are consuming literature digitally in order to save as many trees as possible. But what about all the other stuff that surrounds us? The things we love now but may tire of tomorrow. What about the chairs we sit on, the beds we lie on, the tables we eat from ¡V big-ticket items that strip resources from our precious forests in order to exist for us then clog up the earth¡¦s arteries as waste when we discard them?Luckily, the environmental impact of our furniture is foremost in the minds of many of the manufacturers kitting out our homes today. In fact, if the effects of its material sourcing and making processes aren¡¦t up to scratch, a furniture business will fall behind in the race to becoming carbon neutral.As increasing numbers of professional interior-makers pledge to safeguard the environment with ethical choices, regular consumers are also starting to demand traceability. ¡§Design research is now much more complex than just a visual mood board,¡¨ says interior designer Harriet Paterson. ¡§We need to take a holistic approach and seek out ethical suppliers, brands, and designers who have sustainability deeply rooted in their DNA, their materials and their supply chains. Of course, how something looks remains important, but aesthetic qualities alone are no longer sufficient. Traceability, authenticity and transparency have become our guiding principles.¡¨Furniture manufacturers across the board are stepping up to the mark. ¡§The single biggest thing we can do to reduce the impact of our business on the environment is to ensure we source our raw materials from sustainable sources to protect biodiversity, reduce deforestation and carbon footprint,¡¨ says Suzy McMahon, buying director at Sofology. The British sofa brand, born in 1974, is taking its responsibilities seriously. Seeking to achieve the eco-certification Oeko-Tex Step for its cotton, viscose and polyester upholstery by 2024, it¡¦s also working to achieve FSC certification for its wood components and commits to full traceability for its leathers.Ethical furnishing, however, isn¡¦t just about how an item is made. How you dispose of your old furniture is of equal concern to makers. Before you even get to test the bounce on your new sofa, its end of life has been carefully reviewed. Disassembly has become the surprising new byword for success in furniture marketing. Your seating, believe it or not, has an end-of-life plan.And it¡¦s something Sofology has been passionate about for some time. In 2019, Sofology introduced its recyclable Heron fabric; Pioneer, its first eco-friendly sofa launched in 2020; and this year saw the introduction of the Sustainable Edit ¡V a collection of more environmentally friendly sofas including a model with replaceable covers. Think recycled fabrics that can be repurposed and cushion fillings made from plastic bottles. Some of the collection¡¦s sofa bodies are made from compressed polyester fibres that adequately support bodies and can be repeatedly reused to help support a circular economy.¡§Each year, around 9m tonnes of furniture, in addition to their packaging, goes to landfill,¡¨ says McMahon. ¡§So responsibly recycling or reusing old sofas avoids adding to this environmental damage.¡¨ Sofology¡¦s SofaRescue service collects used sofas and recycles or repurposes their parts to save them from going to landfill.There is also now the option to eschew ownership and rent your furniture, taking the disposability issue out of the equation. Harth ¡V founded by husband and wife team Henrietta Thompson and Ed Padmore in 2018 ¡V is a marketplace where you can rent, sell or buy high-quality, pre-owned homeware. ¡§We wanted to counter the idea that if you needed or wanted something on a temporary basis you should just buy cheap and disposable. That sat really badly with me,¡¨ Thompson says. Inspired by how other industries were making the most of the possibilities afforded by new technology, especially the sharing economy ¡V for example, Airbnb and Uber ¡V and observing the backlash against fast fashion, she set up Harth.A survey conducted by Sofology, meanwhile, revealed that as more and more people are renting their properties long term, more than half of those seeking unfurnished spaces are looking for sustainable furnishing solutions. Sofology has responded with its rental scheme, Loop, which allows you to rent sofas, armchairs and footstools. On return, the item is disassembled and sent for recycling. The metal frame is saved and reupholstered to continue its life in another home.¡§We are seeing more people now furnishing homes not only on the strength of aesthetics but also ethics,¡¨ says Paterson. ¡§What we now know is that when those two things combine, the design moves beyond something that simply looks good to something that makes us feel good. In addition to creating happier and healthier homes, as interior designers, what¡¦s so exciting is we now have many more stories to tell within our projects, not just the fleeting tales of new ¡§looks¡¨, but a richer narrative around longevity, sustainability and wellbeing.¡¨Armchair environmentalism never looked so good.',\n",
              " '¡¥There I was, alone in the apartment where she had died, looking at these pictures of my mother, one by one under the lamp, gradually moving back in time with her, looking for the truth of the face I had loved. And I found it.¡¨This poignant recollection occurs early in the second part of Camera Lucida by the French thinker Roland Barthes. Published in 1980, it remains, alongside Susan Sontag¡¦s On Photography, one of the most influential books ever written on photography. In 2004, it was made into a work of art by Idris Khan, whose single mysterious photographic image is titled Every Single Page of Roland Barthes¡¦s Book Camera Lucida. It haunts the writings of the late WG Sebald and, in 2009, it inspired Photography Degree Zero, an anthology of writings on Barthes.The passage above describes Barthes¡¦s discovery of a portrait of his mother, Henriette, aged five, in which she is standing next to her seven-year-old brother ¡§in a glassed-in conservatory, what was called a winter garden in those days¡¨. For Barthes, grief-stricken by his mother¡¦s recent death, the snapshot by an unknown photographer somehow evokes her ¡§unique being¡¨. He writes: ¡§I studied the little girl and at last rediscovered my mother.¡¨The appearance of the Winter Garden Photograph is a pivotal moment in Camera Lucida, shifting the narrative away from the theoretical towards a personal meditation on loss and photography¡¦s intrinsic relationship to mortality. Barthes had begun writing the book soon after Henriette¡¦s death in 1977 ¡V it had just been published when Barthes himself died in hospital of pulmonary complications, a month after being struck by a laundry van near his home in Paris. Although the snapshot initially made Barthes exclaim: ¡§There she is!¡¨, his analysis of it leads him to question the complex ¡V and essentially bittersweet ¡V nature of that epiphany. Like all family photographs, indeed all photographic portraits, the Winter Garden Photograph is essentially a tantalising glimpse of the irretrievable, a cruel reminder of ¡§what has ceased to be¡¨, and like them it evokes a past we often have no lived memory of, but also a sense of our own encroaching mortality.For all its resonance for Barthes, the Winter Garden Photograph is also the essential mystery at the heart of Camera Lucida. In a narrative punctuated by images by the likes of Andr? Kert?sz, Richard Avedon and Alfred Stieglitz, the snapshot of his mother as a young girl is nowhere to be seen. ¡§I cannot reproduce the Winter Garden Photograph. It exists only for me,¡¨ he writes by way of explanation. ¡§For you, it would be nothing but an indifferent picture, one of the thousand manifestations of the ordinary¡K ¡¨In the 40 years since, by virtue of its very absence, the Winter Garden Photograph has attained an almost mythical aura, so much so that some critics have questioned that it ever existed at all. Nevertheless, it has become firmly lodged in the collective consciousness of photography students and practitioners through the strange, melancholy drift of Barthes¡¦s writing. I cannot be the only photography buff who, while rooting in a junk shop or a flea market stall, has happened on an old, faded photograph of a young girl from another time and thought immediately of Henriette in the Winter Garden.In May 2017, I began rifling though a box of old photos in search of one such image, having received an email from Odette England, aBritish-Australian photographer and academic. It was a request ¡§to submit a single photograph to the Winter Garden Photograph project ... a photographic reflection on Barthes¡¦ unpublished snapshot of his mother¡¨.Now, three years later and just in time for Camera Lucida¡¦s 40th anniversary, England¡¦s ambitious project has come to fruition in a beautifully designed photobook comprising the responses of more than 200 photographers, writers and artists. Entitled Keeper of the Hearth ¡V the French meaning of the name, Henriette ¡V it is by turns fascinating and bemusing.¡§Every single response was included,¡¨ elaborates England. ¡§Forefront in my mind was the question: ¡¥Who am I to say what constitutes a valid or worthwhile interpretation of Barthes¡¦s Winter Garden Photograph?¡¦ I didn¡¦t weed anything out and would have felt disingenuous doing so.¡¨My contribution is a small portrait mounted on time-blemished card of a young girl from another time, sitting on a chair in a garden, wearing a white cotton smock and flower-bedecked hat. A flea market find, it is, in my mind at least, a portrait of the young Henriette, poised and at ease in the camera¡¦s gaze. On the opposite page, a fragment from Camera Lucida, also chosen by me, reads ¡§¡K she triumphed over this ordeal of placing herself in front of the lens ¡K with discretion ¡K She did not struggle with her image, as I do with mine: she did not suppose herself.¡¨ That last phrase, describing the young Henriette, is pure Barthes, astute and playful. It evokes her youthful poise and confidence ¡V and, by extension, her breeding ¡V and Barthes¡¦s own discomfort when posing for a photographic portrait, a discomfort many of us will recognise.I was not the only contributor to combine image and text. The American documentary photographer Alec Soth responded with a portrait of his own mother stretched out on a sofa, beneath a wall of family portraits, one of which shows him as a young boy, grinning and clasping a ball. His text reads, ¡§Twenty years have passed and so much has changed. But that boy and the way he looks at his mother are pretty much the same.¡¨Soth tells me that the older he gets, the more he thinks, like Barthes, that ¡§every photograph has the aura of death¡¨. ¡§The irony about my selection is that my mom is still alive,¡¨ adds Soth, ¡§Nevertheless, when I look at that picture now (it was made 20 years ago), what I see is approaching death. And not just for her!¡¨This sense of time¡¦s inexorable passing is something of a constant. German-born photographer Barbara Diener submitted a picture of her two-year-old self kissing her father through what looks, on first glance, like prison bars. The snapshot was in fact taken on the stairs of their home by Diener¡¦s mother, who titled it on the back: The Kiss. ¡§I always thought it was an interesting photograph ¡V strange and tender at the same time,¡§ says Diener. ¡§It also works metaphorically for the kind of relationship my father and I had. We were close, but there were barriers we could never quite get around.¡¨Since her father¡¦s death 13 years ago, the snapshot has inevitably taken on an added resonance. ¡§Losing him was one of those life-changing, earth-shattering events I am still processing today. Indirectly, my projects since his death convey a sense of loss or longing.¡¨There is longing, too, in the two photographs chosen by Ka-Man Tse. The first is a black and white group photo from 1964, taken by a relative at a family wedding. It is, she says, the earliest existing photograph of her mother, who was 10 years old at the time. ¡§There she is,¡¨ says Tse, ¡§sitting at the end of the table, looking directly at the camera, a child amongst a table of adults, all women.¡¨For her, it carries a similar resonance to the one Barthes identified in the snapshot of his mother. ¡§It¡¦s the chicken in the middle of the table, it¡¦s the look in her eyes, the white socks and her shoes,¡¨ she elaborates, referencing Barthes idea of the ¡§punctum¡¨ - the incidental detail that can unsettle the viewer with its poignancy.Tse¡¦s other submitted image shows five female hands cradling that family snapshot. ¡§The hands on the right side of the frame are my aunt, who was 71 at the time,¡¨ says Tse. ¡§She is actually in the photograph she is holding, but as a teenager. The middle hand is mine, and I¡¦m wearing my own wedding ring in Hong Kong where gay marriage it is neither legal nor recognised.¡¨The past haunts the work of Dan Estabrook, a conceptual artist who uses 19th-century processing techniques to make images that combine photography and collage. ¡§For the last few years, I¡¦ve been using tintypes,¡¨ he says, referring to an early process in which chemicals were used to create images on metal, ¡§which I cut up and reassemble like jigsaw puzzles.¡¨In Estabrook¡¦s collage, the young girl in the foreground has no face, her features having been replaced by an oval of polished silver that is a kind of mirror. ¡§To be honest,¡¨ he says, ¡§I was a little embarrassed at how literally I interpreted the project ¡X I just wanted to make this unseen thing. The polished silver is there, I suppose, for all the self-reflection the image carried for Barthes, and for us now.¡¨Keeper of the Hearth attests to the continuing resonance of an image none of us have seen and that may not even exist, and to the singular spell of Barthes¡¦s odd, mischievous, melancholy take on photography and its seemingly intrinsic relationship to death. For all that, one has to wonder if Camera Lucida¡¦s importance attests above all to the power of words to evoke the ineffable in ways that photography simply cannot.',\n",
              " 'With everyone stuck at home during this moment, it tracks that the windowsill has turned into a canvas, people looking out on the world while sharing something with it.As part of a new photo project, Stephen Lovekin has photographed hopeful messages posted in the windows of his Brooklyn neighborhood of Ditmas Park, an area known for its palatial Victorian homes. The series, Words at the Window: Self Isolation and the Coronavirus, shows roughly 40 couples, families and solo residents of his neighborhood, from children to seniors, pugs and babies in diapers, posing out of the window.¡§I started the project to help neighbors find a way to still feel connected with each other in this ¡¥new normal¡¦ of social distancing and self-isolation,¡¨ says Lovekin. ¡§I also thought the use of the window, as opposed to having my subjects come outside, which complements the isolation idea.¡§The thing I¡¦ve learned about this is that people are strong, kind and good,¡¨ he adds. ¡§I really wanted to make people feel connected.The photos include portraits of the 91-year-old artist Shirley Fuerst, the neighbor and landlady of Lovekin. ¡§We live in a split house and she lives by herself on one side, my family and I live on the other,¡¨ he says. ¡§She continues to work on her art every day up in her studio on the top floor.¡¨In another shot, Guatemalan artist Juan Carlos Pinto poses alongside his family on the fifth floor of a building, holding up a sign that reads: ¡§Together.¡¨ Getting the shot was no easy feat. ¡§For some reason, the only window that would open was the one in front of the fire escape,¡¨ says Lovekin. ¡§You can only really see their eyes through the slats.¡¨There¡¦s also a pensive-looking shot of Robert E Clark Jr, who runs a community radio station called Cortelyou Road Radio, the only one of its kind in Ditmas Park. He¡¦s holding a sign behind a screen window that reads: ¡§Tough times never last ... but tough people do.¡¨The phrases are all hopeful, from ¡§This too shall pass¡¨ to ¡§Waiting with you¡¨ (one ¡§off-brand¡¨ message with children says: ¡§We are so bored¡¨).Ditmas Park, a largely residential neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn, is lined with stately homes, many of which are divided into multiple apartments. Brooklyn is among the boroughs that has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, proving the coronavirus isn¡¦t an equalizer. ¡§One of the things I love about Brooklyn is that people tend to come together in times of need,¡¨ says Lovekin, a staff photographer with Shutterstock. ¡§Even though this is so hard, I think we will come through it together.Lovekin still abides by social distancing rules while shooting, using a zoom lens to maintain a safe distance from his subjects and wearing protective gear. ¡§I make sure I am wearing a mask and gloves and always have some hand sanitizer, as well,¡¨ he adds.In one memorable photo, psychotherapist Marge Blaine poses alongside Ed Blaine, a writer and playwright, while holding up a sign that reads: ¡¥Keep calm, wash your hands ¡V and carry on!¡¦¡§It¡¦s a way of connecting with others when most of our time is being spent alone at home,¡¨ says Dr Blaine. ¡§Since we visit the UK every year, we¡¦re familiar with the phrase and it seemed particularly apt here, with the addition of the reminder to keep washing hands.¡¨There¡¦s one photo of gallerist Tom Parker and his wife Elizabeth and their children posing with the sign: ¡§Never doubt the capacity of the human spirit.¡¨¡§In all this madness, you¡¦re looking for things that resonate and seem important,¡¨ says Parker. ¡§That stuck out as having real seriousness and poignancy.¡¨The Parker family are accompanied by their dog Gypsy, peeking out the window with them. ¡§I love the sign about the strength of the human spirit and our dog sitting right there, with us,¡¨ he says.¡§The human spirit has prevailed throughout the history of mankind; overcoming pandemics, world wars, natural disasters,¡¨ says Parker. ¡§Ultimately, we survive.

              " 'If you want to see who influences the government, you can do worse than look at Whitehall¡¦s neighbours. In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side.Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members¡¦ fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its Red Book, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a triumphant bonfire of red tape, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as ¡§unlocking the inherent value held within the world¡¦s physical assets¡¨, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out?In the eyes of Bob Colenutt, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, The Property Lobby, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper ¡V at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it.Many books have attempted to explain the roots of Britain¡¦s housing crisis, but Colenutt is better placed than most to unpick the mess. His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led Coin Street housing project on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored The Property Machine, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people¡¦s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force.Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the ¡§finance-housebuilding complex¡¨, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests.Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on council house waiting lists and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty ¡V not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic ¡V but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be delivered through ¡§planning gain¡¨. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the ¡§regeneration¡¨ of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the break-up of communities. It¡¦s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to ¡§the ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.¡¨Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. Berkeley Group, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes ¡V proudly described as ¡§popular with overseas investors¡¨ ¡V was 715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company¡¦s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of 48m in 2018, after a previous payout of 23m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the local authority targets were ¡§unviable¡¨. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than 3bn.As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of Michael Heseltine¡¦s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the Queen¡¦s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014. The next year, Pidgley gave a donation to the Conservative party and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies.Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by government subsidy through Help to Buy, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to dodge their affordable housing obligations. The Chartered Institute for Housing estimated that of the total 53bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its CEO Jeff Fairburn a 75m bonus, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process.All of this is great news for the Home Builders Federation, the powerful volume housebuilders¡¦ lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the ¡§viability assessment¡¨ of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of land-banking and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits.The list of powerful interests goes on. There is the CLA (formerly the Country Landowners¡¦ Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that landowners in England made a 13bn profit from land sales in 2016-17, far more than Amazon¡¦s net annual global profit in the same period, or since. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a ¡§Stalinist land grab¡¨ or a ¡§garden tax¡¨.Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the revolving doors between councils and developers, to the culture of hospitality and political donations, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that riddle the planning system ¡V which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers¡¦ profits.There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, ¡§part of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right¡¨. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry ¡V a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed.Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the examples of Germany and the Netherlands, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators.He says it is finally time to tax developers¡¦ land banks and implement ¡§use or lose it¡¨ measures, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already beginning to take the lead, in spite of central government policy. As the Coin Street Community Builders¡¦ slogan puts it: ¡§There is another way.¡¨ Seeing the stark reality spelled out in such clear terms in this book, there is no longer any excuse not to act.',\n",
              " 'My mother, the artist Charlotte Leadbeater, who has died aged 77, was a founding member of the King Street gallery, an artists¡¦ co-operative in Carmarthen, Wales, and also exhibited nationally and internationally. Charlotte painted dramatic landscapes and portraits, usually in oil on canvas, but she also enjoyed working in oil pastel, watercolours and mixed media, made etchings, and more recently had started to experiment with digital drawings.Her portrait subjects would comment on how she was able to capture the very essence of the person she painted ¡V although this did not always make them happy. She would look for interesting subjects with depth or movement and preferred to work from life rather than from still photos. Born in Dronfield, Derbyshire, Charlotte was the daughter of Wing Commander John Yonge, an RAF pilot, and his wife, Enid (nee Blanch), who worked in surveillance for MI5. After being discharged from the air force, John taught at a boys¡¦ school in Cyprus, where Charlotte went to the local convent school. After the family¡¦s return to the UK in 1957 she took a foundation course at Canterbury Art School, where she also discovered a passion for set design at the Marlow theatre. She then went to Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, London, graduating in 1967.The following year, she married Charles Brewster, and soon they had two children, me and my brother, Demian. In 1973 we moved to Wales, where Charlotte loved the wild landscape. The marriage ended in divorce, and then, while taking Welsh lessons, Charlotte met Tim Leadbeater, a computer programmer and fellow artist. They married in 1977 and my brother Rhiwallon was born in 1979.She took up a part-time position teaching art at Christ college, a boarding school in Brecon in 1977, later becoming head of department there. Charlotte was renowned for her school trips to London, Amsterdam and Italy, where she always managed to secure access to the best exhibitions. She also lectured at the Swansea Institute of Higher Education (now part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David) and ran adult education classes through Swansea University.Charlotte loved theatre and ballet, and jumped at the opportunity to travel in 1998 with her sister, Jane, to St Petersburg, where she spent the summer as artist in residence with the Kirov Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre. The resulting work was exhibited at the Vaganova Academy the following year. Upon her return Charlotte was instrumental in the running of a Russian ballet troupe, Ballet Russe, at the Grand theatre in Swansea for 10 years.She made an immense contribution to the artistic and cultural life of Llandeilo, her home town since 1983. In 1980 the town had been twinned with Le Conquet in France, and she became secretary of the twinning association. She was among those who set up the Llandeilo Arts Group, which attracted musical, dance and arts events to the town. Charlotte was a powerhouse of activity and whenever she joined a committee, events would be organised and crowds would arrive. In 2009 she served as mayor of Llandeilo. More recently she ran Tywi Valley open studios and workshops for the local community.Charlotte is survived by Tim, Demian, Rhiwallon and me, and her siblings, Mark and Jane.',\n",
              " '¡§More good quality, attractive and affordable homes faster.¡¨ According to the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, that is the main aim of his ¡§complete overhaul¡¨ of the English planning system, announced on Thursday. Yet there is precious little evidence that any of the new measures could lead to higher quality, more attractive or more affordable homes. Instead, the proposals look set to deliver the exact opposite.In an unprecedented move that betrays the Dominic Cummings hallmark of maximum disruption with minimum effort, the government is tearing up the national rule book that has been in place since the second world war to ensure the best use of land, and replacing it with three simple classifications. From now on, all land in England will be designated for either ¡§growth¡¨, with automatic planning permission, ¡§renewal¡¨, with permission subject to some basic checks, or ¡§protection¡¨, preserving the sacrosanct status of the green belt.It is doing this in the name of cutting red tape and speeding up the planning process, yet there is no sign that the planning system is standing in the way of delivering homes. Records compiled by the Local Government Association show that around 90% of planning applications are approved, while there are more than a million homes with planning permission that have not yet been built.The rule book is also being shredded in the name of ¡§beauty¡¨, with the idea that proposals will be subject to design codes and developers encouraged to follow pattern books, citing the precedents of Bath, Belgravia and Bournville. There is the added promise of ¡§a fast-track system for beautiful buildings¡¨ but no hint as to who the arbiter of beauty may be. Who comes up with these codes, who draws the patterns, and who judges if a proposal meets the criteria remains to be seen.What is more certain is that the reforms will effectively cut democratic input into the planning process by half. At present, there are two opportunities for accountability and oversight, one at the creation of a local plan and one at the final consent of a planning application. The reforms propose to move all democratic accountability to the plan-making stage, set to be drawn up for each area within 30 months. From now on, if you want to object to a new development, you will have to have been there to feed into the discussion several years before it was even proposed.Beyond the flagship measures, the small print also notes that the government plans to extend the current exemption of small sites from having to make Section 106 payments towards affordable housing. Branded as helping developers ¡§bounce back from the economic impact of coronavirus¡¨, it will further reduce the small quantities of affordable homes that councils are struggling to provide.Besides the recent extension of permitted development rights, England has dabbled with planning deregulation in limited form in the past, namely with the creation of Enterprise Zones in 1980 under Margaret Thatcher, an attempt to kickstart regeneration with tax cuts and planning freedoms. The result was a proliferation of out-of-town business parks and clusters of industrial sheds at motorway junctions, all built to the minimum standards. The policy was revived in 2011, in an effort to ignite development in areas like London¡¦s Royal Dock, where it spawned a soulless Chinese-funded business park that still lies empty. A report last year concluded that the policy ¡§failed to deliver¡¨ the promised jobs boost.For examples of planning deregulation on the scale of this new announcement, we must look overseas. Both Ireland and Spain suffered the consequences of wholesale planning liberalisation in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when tens of thousands of homes were built in ill-conceived housing estates in far-flung locations, spurred on by a flood of cheap credit. Many were left unfinished and abandoned, haunting the landscape with ¡§ghost estates¡¨ when the property bubble burst.Other examples of ¡§automatic planning permission¡¨ can be found in the kind of zonal planning systems used in the US and parts of Europe. One of the chief implications of zonal planning is that the initial allocation of land in a zone assumes total importance: it must pre-empt everything that a future applicant might propose, as there is no safeguard further down the line.The results are both crude, separating the different functions of a city into segregated zones, and mired in fiendish complexity. In New York City, for example, whose skyline is famously a product of its zoning ordinances, there are 21 basic zoning districts, each having additional sub-categories for specific requirements, listed in the 4,300+ page-long Zoning Resolution. Interpreting the finer points of these codes has become an entire industry in itself, keeping well-paid planning consultants in high demand. It has a dark history, too: exclusionary zoning has been one of the biggest drivers of racial segregation across America.At the opposite end of the scale is the German zoning model, which promotes mixed use, with detailed frameworks agreed at federal level, while states and local authorities retain powers to make specific provisions. Every block is carefully masterplanned in advance, specifying the exact mix of uses, massing and open space, providing certainty to developers about what is allowed. In order to provide that certainty, a huge amount of detail has to be worked out in advance ¡V far more than is contained in an English Local Plan, documents which take councils several years to compile as it stands. It is hard to imagine how any zonal system could possibly be the silver bullet to ¡§get the country building¡¨ any quicker.All of this seems to have passed the UK government by. The proposed ¡§planning revolution¡¨ bears all of the signs of policy advisers who don¡¦t actually understand the complexity of the system they are so keen to destroy. It is disruptive ideology writ large, picking on an already weakened target for a hastily-devised experiment on a national scale. It aims for beauty, quality and affordability, but it will likely unleash a race to the bottom, with smaller, meaner, less affordable homes ¡V and nothing left in the way to stop them.',\n",
              " 'Tate has announced 313 redundancies across its commercial enterprises, which include staff who work in publishing and in gallery shops, cafes and restaurants in London, Liverpool and St Ives.An email to staff was sent on Tuesday evening from the Tate director, Maria Balshaw, and the chief operating officer, Vicky Cheetham, announcing what they said were ¡§difficult and painful¡¨ decisions.The figure ¡V almost half of the 640 workforce ¡V is bigger than the 200 redundancies which had previously been speculated on. Balshaw, speaking on Radio 4¡¦s Desert Island Discs at the weekend, said 50% fewer visitors would be coming to the galleries for probably quite a long time.¡§Sadly, at the moment, the trading business is too big because we won¡¦t be able to open all the cafes and the shops in the same way.¡¨Tate Enterprises (TEL) staff who are members of the PCS union last week voted for industrial action, which could result in more than 100 workers going on strike from 18 August.Concerns have also been expressed that the job cuts could disproportionately affect black and minority ethnic staff.In their email, posted on Twitter by the White Pube, Balshaw and Cheetham address those concerns and say: ¡§First of all it is important to say that we do not yet know the outcome until selection processes are completed. However, it is likely that the proportion of BAME colleagues across Tate Enterprises will remain broadly the same at the end of the process.¡¨They say Tate has given TEL 5m from its reserves to cover losses and ensure the future of the business. ¡§As well as this, Tate Gallery could have expected to receive at least 5m in income from TEL over the course of the year and this will now be lost.¡¨Tate will benefit from a share of the government¡¦s 1.57bn recovery package to help arts and culture in the UK, sectors which are among those hit hardest by the pandemic.PCS has said the figure for Tate is 7m. Despite this, ¡§management is pushing ahead with unnecessary and damaging staff cuts which will greatly hinder the galleries from providing a unique cultural service¡¨.Balshaw said the consultation on job losses had been delayed as long as possible. ¡§We don¡¦t want to lose any staff but we know we have to otherwise the business won¡¦t be able to trade,¡¨ she told Lauren Laverne on Desert Island Discs. Staff who lose their jobs would be given the first opportunity to return post-Covid, she added.A joint statement from Hamish Anderson and Carmel Allen, directors of Tate Enterprises, said: ¡§We have worked hard and exhaustively, to model as optimistically as we can for the future and to keep as many jobs as possible.¡§We regret that, following collective consultation, we will have to make 313 redundancies in Tate Enterprises Ltd. The selection process across these roles will take place over the coming weeks. It is with great sadness that we have been forced by the current circumstances to have to make these decisions. We recognise how difficult this must be for our colleagues and aim to be as supportive as we can while still ensuring the future of the business.¡¨Steven Warwick, PCS culture group secretary, said the cuts were ¡§brutal¡¨ and ¡§incredibly disappointing¡¨.He added: ¡§We don¡¦t think any redundancies should be made while executives at Tate are still earning hundreds of thousands of pounds salaries. These cuts will disproportionately affect the lowest paid and the most diverse teams across the whole of the Tate estate.¡¨ Job losses on an unprecedented scale are looming for galleries, theatres and music venues across the UK despite the government¡¦s financial package.On Wednesday, Sadler¡¦s Wells became the latest performing arts organisation to announce it was consulting on redundancies. It said 51 jobs were at risk ¡V 26% of its permanent and fixed term workforce. The Southbank Centre in London has announced 400 redundancies. An open letter has called the job cuts brutal and warned that a proposed restructuring will result in ¡§irrevocable damage¡¨ to the centre. It has been signed by more than 7,000 people.Over the weekend the centre¡¦s senior artistic team responded to the letter and said the centre would lose 25m over the course of the financial year. Almost all reserves have been used. ¡§Our choices are limited,¡¨ they wrote. ¡§We must radically reduce our expenditure.¡¨',\n",
              " 'From the moment the coronavirus spilled out of China and spread around the world, the great hope for the return of normal life lay with safe and effective vaccines. While wearing masks and washing hands helped to reduce the flood of infections, they would never be enough to hold back the tide. Social distancing ¡V a phrase that does nothing to convey the hardship of the act ¡V suppresses the virus, no doubt. But what kind of life is a life lived apart?In response to the pandemic, the first great shock of the 21st century, scientists around the world came together in a staggering effort to tackle the crisis. No element of that work has been more impressive than the rapid development and testing of vaccines. To have shots in the arms of the most vulnerable people, which protect them against a virus unheard of 12 months ago, is an achievement worth reflecting upon.Scientists at Oxford University were among the small number of teams at the forefront of the race to find a Covid vaccine. In the space of 10 months, they designed and manufactured a candidate vaccine and proved its safety and efficacy through rigorous clinical trials in tens of thousands of volunteers in multiple countries. The shots are now being churned out in their millions, and by agreement with Oxford¡¦s partner, AstraZeneca, will be sold at cost price to poorer countries.It all starts at the Jenner institute at Oxford University. Named after Edward Jenner, the 18th-century pioneer of immunisations, the institute ranks as one of the world¡¦s premier vaccine research centres.Step one was to design the vaccine. In modern vaccine research facilities, much of this work is performed on a computer. On the morning of Saturday 11 January, within hours of the virus¡¦s genetic sequence being published online, a team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford, downloaded the code as a text file. They found the genetic instructions for the ¡§spike¡¨ protein that studs the surface of the virus. This tiny club-like protein is swiftly recognised by the immune system.The Oxford vaccine is based on a virus that causes common colds in chimpanzees. This adenovirus is engineered so that it cannot replicate in human cells, meaning it cannot cause an infection. It is then modified further to carry the genetic instructions for the coronavirus spike protein. A shot of the vaccine releases vaccine virus particles into the body. Once inside, these particles enter cells and deliver their cargo of spike protein instructions. The cells then start to make spike proteins ¡V each one a tiny, harmless fragment of the coronavirus ¡V and these are ferried to the surfaces of the cells. Protruding like red flags, the immune system swiftly spots them. It raises an army of antibodies and T cells that are then primed to fight the coronavirus.As scientists at the Jenner institute ran tests in the lab and arranged for the necessary animal studies, the clinical biomanufacturing facility geared up to produce the medical-grade doses that would be needed for human trials. It is a meticulous, multi-staged process performed under increasingly stringent clean room conditions to ensure none of the raw materials, the final doses or vials become contaminated before they reach trial participants.The work starts with a strand of DNA brought across the car park from the Jenner institute. The DNA contains the genetic instructions for the vaccine adenovirus, complete with the code for the spike protein. Add this to modified human cells and they will take up the instructions and churn out adenovirus vaccine particles. Eventually, the cell makes so many that the vaccine particles burst out.The step is repeated multiple times. The vaccine particles that erupt from the single cell are added to a fresh batch of modified human cells, infecting those and producing yet more vaccine adenovirus. These are then added to more human cells, and on it goes, until a decent stock of sterile vaccine doses has been built up. Only genetically modified human cells can make the vaccine because these alone contain a gene, named E1, that the adenovirus needs to replicate.Each batch of vaccine made this way is purified to remove the ruptured cells that litter the nutrient-rich liquid. But another step is needed before the doses are ready for awaiting arms. Some adenovirus particles are duds: they assemble as empty shells that are missing their DNA. To separate them out, the liquid is spun down in a centrifuge. The valuable DNA-filled adenovirus particles settle into a band from which doses can then be taken, ready to administer as jabs.The Oxford scientists launched trials in Britain and around the world. To make enough doses for the volunteers, they sent ¡§starter material¡¨ to factories far and wide ¡V to Advent in Rome, Halix in the Netherlands, and the Serum Institute of India. Those who signed up for the trials were randomly assigned to receive the Oxford vaccine or a control vaccine. Most received two full shots, four weeks apart, but others received a half dose followed by a full dose a month later.Throughout the trial, clinicians on the team took blood samples from the participants to measure how their immune systems responded. But whether the vaccine worked would only become clear with time: who went on to fall ill with the virus? The vaccinated group or the control?In late November, interim results from Oxford¡¦s trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 62% in those who received two full shots, rising ¡V intriguingly ¡V to 90% in those who had half a dose followed by a full one. It is not yet clear why this would be, but research is afoot to solve the puzzle.Oxford Biomedica is manufacturing tens of millions of doses of the vaccine on behalf on AstraZeneca. Production involves various stages, starting with a vial of a frozen master bank of cells, which are thawed out and transferred into larger and larger solutions of media, each time being given time to grow. This takes several weeks until eventually there is enough vaccine to fill a 1,000-litre bioreactor. The solution then goes through a process of separation, purification and concentration before being frozen into 15-litre bags which are stored in special trays, ready to be transferred into individual dose vials at a fill/finish house at a different location.At Wockhardt in Wrexham, one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the UK, the vaccine that was manufactured at Oxford Biomedica and developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group is transferred into vials before being packaged ready for distribution.In December, following 11 intense months of vaccine development, manufacture and trials, the Oxford vaccine is poised for approval by medicines regulators. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, has been conducting a rolling review of clinical trials data so it can reach a decision swiftly. Other regulators will perform their own assessments.Upon approval, a major operation will swing into action to distribute the vaccine from storage facilities to countries around the world. Here, the Oxford vaccine has an advantage. Two other frontrunner vaccines, from Pfizer/BioNTech and the US National Institutes of Health/Moderna, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures until shortly before they are used. This makes distribution of the shots a formidable challenge in some parts of the world. The Oxford vaccine isn¡¦t as fragile and can be stored for long periods at 2C to 4C, or standard refrigeration temperatures. The Oxford vaccine is much cheaper too: about one-tenth of the cost of the other two.AstraZeneca, Oxford¡¦s industrial partner, has agreed a deal to supply the vaccine at about 2 a dose through Covax, a system set up by the vaccine alliance Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization, to ensure all countries, rich and poor, have equitable access to tests, treatments and vaccines. Delivery of the first 300m doses should begin by the end of the year, with 2bn shots available by the end of 2021. A separate agreement with the Serum Institute of India ¡V the world¡¦s largest vaccine producer ¡V secures 400m doses before the end of 2020.Only once the shots reach people¡¦s arms will the benefits be felt from this staggering and unprecedented scientific effort. There was a time when the cavalry brandished sabres and rifles. Today they arrive bearing needles.',\n",
              " 'Jae Rhim Lee is describing what she would like to happen to her body after she dies. No simple coffin or cremation for her. Instead, the South Korean artist is keen to be devoured ¡V which is why she has designed a burial suit that, in her own words, looks like ¡§ninja pyjamas¡¨. Covering every part of her body, the outfit is black with white, branch-like patterns forking down it. The lining, she goes on to explain in an intriguing video posted online in 2011, will be filled with mushroom spores that have been ¡§trained¡¨ to recognise her as food, thanks to having being fed bits of Lee¡¦s shed skin, hair and nails. After she dies, she will be placed in the suit and these cultivated mushrooms will ¡V hopefully ¡V eat her. As she says: ¡§For some of you, this might be really, really out there.¡¨ Well, yes. But no more out there than a lot of the strange things on display at Mushrooms: The Art, Design and Future of Fungi, a new exhibition at Somerset House, London, that aims to show how, over the last few decades, mushrooms have become muses for artists, as well as useful tools for them to work with. ¡§Mushrooms are playful,¡¨ says Francesca Gavin, who curated the show and runs the Instagram page @theartofmushrooms. ¡§They¡¦re colourful. They remind us of childhood. They¡¦re also delightfully phallic, which is always a pleasure.¡¨¡§They are neither plants nor animals,¡¨ says Anne Ratti, a London-based artist who turned her studio into a laboratory to grow magic mushrooms. ¡§They belong to a strange kingdom of their own. They have their own way to grow and to reproduce in ¡V and in between ¡V everything. Mushrooms have no borders!¡¨The show certainly serves up mushrooms in an impressive variety of ways. British designer Tom Dixon is making a prototype chair out of mycelium, the mass of thin threads that make up the body of a fungus. German conceptual artist Carsten H?ller has come up with a solar-powered mushroom suitcase. And there will be plenty of trippy, psilocybin-inspired visions from the likes of Jeremy Shaw, though Gavin stresses that psychedelia is just one small part of what the mushroom kingdom can offer the art world. Even the typeface used on the gallery walls was ¡§grown¡¨ using an algorithm that mimics fungal growth.You might think that finding so many mushroom-influenced artists would take quite a bit of foraging, but Gavin says it couldn¡¦t have been easier. In fact, this is her second mushroom-themed exhibition, a smaller one having already been a success in Paris. She says she could have made this show much bigger had she wished: ¡§Type in the name of any artist of the last five years with the word ¡¥mushroom¡¦ and you¡¦ll find plenty of work.¡¨One of those artists is David Fenster, who likes mushrooms so much he sometimes dresses as one. His friend, the costume designer EB Brooks, made him an outfit based on the fly amanita (the red toadstool with white speckles that¡¦s always cropping up in children¡¦s stories such as Alice in Wonderland) using a bicycle helmet and insulating wrap.¡§I wear the costume as often as possible,¡¨ says Fenster. ¡§Like mushrooms themselves, it seems to attract or repel depending on the individual. It definitely gets people¡¦s attention ¡V and I think mushrooms deserve our attention. They¡¦re overlooked, especially in fungiphobic cultures like ours, which is probably why artists are so interested in them.¡¨Fenster is a film-maker and the costume features in one of his pieces, Fly Amanita, in which the mushroom reflects on the way it¡¦s been treated by human beings over the years. ¡§People used to mix my ancestors in a bowl with milk and put the mixture out to kill flies,¡¨ it says at one point, before bemoaning the way pop culture has warped its public image. ¡§People don¡¦t realise that this thing they see in a Mario Bros game is a representation of a real mushroom that actually exists!¡¨ As Fenster puts it: ¡§I thought it would be funny to make a film about an anthropomorphised mushroom complaining about how humans have anthropomorphised nature.¡¨Mushrooms have long fascinated artists. There are all sorts of examples, from 17th-century Flemish and German baroque art to Victorian fairy paintings, on the North American Mycological Association website. But fungi have perhaps never been seen as a key muse. A new book, Feast & Fast: The Art of Food in Europe 1500-1800, doesn¡¦t even give them a mention in its index.Over the last half a century, however, they¡¦ve provided much nourishment for artistic minds. Cy Twombly painted them; Andy Warhol filmed painter Robert Indiana chomping on one in his 1963 film Eat; John Cage even co-wrote a book about them, Mushroom Book (1972), which now resides in MoMA¡¦s collection. Cage was particularly obsessed ¡V writing mushroom poems, creating mushroom ketchup recipes for Vogue magazine and, in 1962, even founding the most recent incarnation of the New York Mycological Society. ¡§I have come to the conclusion that much can be learned about music by devoting oneself to the mushroom,¡¨ Cage explained in the Music Lovers¡¦ Field Companion (1954).Around the turn of the century, I even had my own mushroom mania moment when, writing in the NME, I coined the term shroomadelica: a short-lived genre for such bands as the Delays and the Zutons, whose light psychedelia chimed with the legal loophole that allowed people to ingest magic mushrooms in the UK. But these examples are mere spores compared with the current boom in mushroom-related art.Gavin says that books by Michael Pollan and anthropologist Anna Tsing have been key to turning artists into fungiphiles. Fenster, meanwhile, says he was hooked when he saw the cover to David Arora¡¦s 1991 mushroom foraging guide All That the Rain Promises and More. This shows a bearded, slightly crazed-looking man wearing a tuxedo standing in a field holding a trumpet and a bunch of mushrooms. The text mixes traditional field guide information with jokes and poetry ¡V and it so enraptured Fenster that he made a film about its author called, fabulously, The Michael Jordan of Mycology (confusingly, there is also a British mycologist called ¡K Michael Jordan).The show will also feature The Mycological Twist, AKA Elo?se Bonneviot and Anne de Boer, who were drawn into the world of mushrooms after reading an article that suggested fungi could break down the waste caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It inspired the pair to look into doing the same in a patch of garden at the London exhibition space JupiterWoods. More recent fungal projects include Respawn, a science-fiction movie told from the perspective of mushrooms; and Foraging Bags, an attempt to create portraits of a space¡¦s local ecology using thin fabric bags, mushroom spores and edibles gathered from parks.¡§The urgency of the climate crisis is more palpable every day,¡¨ say the pair over email. ¡§It¡¦s hard for an artist to create any other work. There¡¦s a growing interest in veganism, Extinction Rebellion and cutting back single-plastic use, and foraging for mushrooms definitely belongs in this list. Because they are so entangled into ecosystems, they have a potential to be subversives. They remain mysterious, resisting labelling and understanding. They are something you collaborate with rather than simply use.¡¨Lee¡¦s burial suit was conceived along the same lines. She wanted to be eaten by mushrooms because she was concerned about the many toxins left in our body after we die, from BPA (bisphenol A) picked up from plastic packaging to the mercury in fillings. The funeral industry is incredibly polluting, delivering toxins back into the environment, yet mushrooms have the power to cleanse. Anyone wearing Lee¡¦s suit would achieve a genuinely green way of dying. The more you read about mushrooms, the more wormholes you fall down and the more you can see why artists are falling in love with them. Gavin talks enthusiastically about the similarity between mushrooms and the human brain, and how we have DNA related to them. The Mycological Twist rave about the way mushrooms create networks that allow trees and plants to talk to each other, something known in mycological circles as the Wood Wide Web. ¡§That tree in your garden is probably hooked up to a bush several metres away, thanks to mycelia,¡¨ they say. ¡§These threads act as a kind of underground internet.¡¨Meanwhile, Fenster tells me about the world¡¦s largest organism ¡V a mycelial mat that covers more than 2,000 acres of Oregon¡¦s Malheur National Forest ¡V and explains how mushroom spores can survive even in space. The mind-blowing facts just keep on coming for these fascinating organisms that can be both beautiful and ugly, nourishing and deadly, intriguing and unknowable.¡§What can we learn from them?¡¨ says Fenster. ¡§Basically everything.

              " 'It was while visiting a brothel on the outskirts of Reno, Nevada, that Rem Koolhaas had his latest epiphany. The Dutch architect was there to meet Lance Gilman, the cowboy hat-wearing proprietor of the Mustang Ranch bordello who is the unlikely visionary behind some of the planet¡¦s largest yet least known buildings. What Koolhaas saw that day would radically alter his thinking on the future of architecture.A short drive from the heart-shaped swimming pools and red faux crocodile-skin furniture of Gilman¡¦s office in the adult resort, a strange apparition of enormous white rectangles appeared in the desert. ¡§It is a fantastically beautiful landscape,¡¨ says Koolhaas, ¡§with rolling hills and wild horses. And in the middle of it all were these colossal structures, placed in a way that didn¡¦t seem to suggest any coherence or sign of human inhabitation.¡¨If you look at the area on Google Earth, these blocks appear like large chalky fields, or the salt evaporation pools of a lithium mine. But they are mines of a different kind: vast industrial sheds housing the technology behind the blockchain, the cloud, and the future of electric vehicles.This is the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), the largest industrial park in the world, a 107,000-acre swath of the Nevada desert that has become the backroom for Silicon Valley¡¦s big tech companies, lured here by the favourable tax regime and instant building permits. Gilman bought the land for 20m in 1998 from Gulf Oil, which had planned to fill it with big game and turn it into a luxury hunting reserve. Gilman quickly had it zoned for industrial use, and the big boxes have sprung up like rectangular fungi after rain. It is now home to gargantuan hangars for Google and Apple, along with distribution warehouses for businesses such as Walmart and Amazon, and the new Tesla battery ¡§Gigafactory¡¨ ¡V set to be, at 1m sq metres, the world¡¦s biggest building when finally complete.It might be fitting that a brothel baron now presides over a landscape of ¡§fulfilment centres¡¨ of another kind, but what interested Koolhaas wasn¡¦t the developer, nor the chance of another commission. It was that the buildings were thrillingly different from anything he had encountered before.¡§There has been no architecture of a similar vigour in the last 100 years,¡¨ he writes in an ode to the sheds. ¡§It is based strictly on codes, algorithms, technologies, engineering and performance, not intention. Its boredom is hypnotic, its banality breathtaking.¡¨ For Koolhaas, these buildings embody a new kind of sublime.A pair of 12ft-high photographs of the data centres now hang on the top floor of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, occupying the final level of a sprawling exhibition, momentously titled Countryside, The Future, set to open next week. Five years in the making, and drawing on a decade of research undertaken by his team at AMO (the ¡§thinktank¡¨ of Koolhaas¡¦s practice, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, or OMA) and armies of volunteer students, the scope of the show is nothing if not ambitious.¡§We decided to focus on the 98% of the Earth¡¦s surface that is not occupied by cities,¡¨ says Koolhaas, casually, as if the prospect were like any other design brief. ¡§At a certain point, the UN declared that half of mankind is now living in cities, since when there has been an avalanche of books and biennales talking only about cities. As a result, there is an enormous deficit in understanding what is happening in the countryside, which is where the truly radical changes are taking place.¡¨At the age of 75, Koolhaas is turning his back on the very thing that made his career. For the last 40 years he has been the seer of cities, provocative poet of the urban condition, producing polemical texts on the unintended consequences of modernity. He made his name with the sizzling ¡§retroactive manifesto¡¨ for Manhattan, Delirious New York, in 1978. Since then he has theorised on everything from the explosion of Chinese megacities to the lure of shopping malls, and the proliferation of bland ¡§junkspace¡¨ in airports and business parks. His tone is at once celebratory and contemptuous, as if simultaneously intoxicated and repelled by the phenomena he describes. The buildings produced by OMA have occupied a similar realm, treading a fine line between the bold and banal. They often reflect the unvarnished, brute reality of the city and, more recently in the case of his blocky, mixed-use building the Timmerhuis in Rotterdam, the naked financial interests that shaped them.But now the rest of the world has caught up and the urban obsession has taken over, the self-styled contrarian has had to move on. ¡§I am interested in the countryside now for the same reason that I was paying attention to New York in the 70s,¡¨ Koolhaas says. ¡§Because no one else was looking.¡¨His interest in rural transformation was first piqued by changes that he noticed in a Swiss village in the Engadin valley, where he had holidayed for years. The area¡¦s population was decreasing, yet the village was expanding, with an ever-increasing number of holiday homes and a new demographic: urbanites seeking wellness, accompanied by a transitory community of south Asian housemaids. These discoveries prompted Koolhaas to survey a chunk of the Dutch countryside, where he found farmers diversifying alongside an influx of wealthy city-dwellers wanting to sample life in the country, ¡§attracted by the aura of authenticity¡¨.¡§We started to find deeply absurd conditions,¡¨ he says. The more he looked, the more he started to see the global countryside as an enormous canvas on which anything too large, complex or unsafe to blend with urban life takes place. ¡§A world formerly dictated by the seasons and the organisation of agriculture,¡¨ he writes, ¡§is now a toxic mix of genetic experiment, science, industrial nostalgia, seasonal immigration, territorial buying sprees, massive subsidies, incidental inhabitation, tax incentives, investment, political turmoil ¡V in other words more volatile than the most accelerated city.¡¨ While we were all concentrating on cities, he argues, the next revolution was forging ahead in the hinterland, undisturbed.There is a naivety to how Koolhaas recounts some of these revelations, which suggests a sheltered urbanite whose musings on rural life are as ill-fitting as muddy wellies in his Prada wardrobe. Yet much of the strength of his work has come from approaching topics as an innocent outsider. One mentor from his early life as a journalist, before he moved into architecture, told him to treat every situation as if he was a Martian new to Earth. It can be a compelling style of writing, but will this detached observer¡¦s deadpan study of disparate rural phenomena translate into a meaningful exhibition?The sense that this is no ordinary Guggenheim show will begin before you enter the building. Visitors will be greeted by a gigantic hi-tech tractor, capable of being controlled from an iPad, parked on the pavement next to a large module growing tomatoes under pink light: objects from the digitised frontline of agriculture brought back to the city.In a manner reminiscent of the architect Philip Johnson¡¦s seminal Machine Art show in 1934 at New York¡¦s Museum of Modern Art (which placed utilitarian, industrially manufactured objects in a museum setting for the first time) visitors will encounter a satellite dangling in the atrium, along with a big bale of hay and an underwater drone designed to patrol coral reefs. From here, the rotunda spiral will extend upwards in a continuous stream of consciousness, with sections on leisure, politics, preservation, agricultural automation and numerous other facets of rural existence that have preoccupied the busy Dutchman and his extensive cast of collaborators.¡§It is a total panoply of voices and themes, cutting across space and time in a really unconventional way,¡¨ says Guggenheim curator Troy Conrad Therrien. ¡§It abandons the usual museological preciousness of classification and creates juxtapositions intended to make people think.¡¨The list of themes reads like the contents page of National Geographic crossed with Wired. It includes the countryside as a cradle of culture in ancient China and Rome; how dictators from Stalin to Mao have left their mark on the land; the ways that Chinese investment is transforming chunks of Africa; how refugees have been housed in abandoned towns in eastern Germany; how gorillas are interacting with tourists in the Congo; the impact of thawing permafrost in Siberia; technological change in American midwest farms. The list goes on. They sound like fascinating, urgent stories, but it is hard to see how they might form a coherent narrative. And what has it all got to do with architecture?¡§It has nothing to do with architecture,¡¨ Koolhaas admits. ¡§It is more anthropological and sociological. I find it exciting that an art institution would dedicate so much space to something that is not art or architecture.¡¨ Therrien describes it as a ¡§pointillist portrait of a mutating territory¡¨, a show about curiosity and questioning rather than providing answers. ¡§Will it feel overwhelming to the visitor? Yes.¡¨ Might it feel colonialist and out of touch? Maybe. ¡§We haven¡¦t tried to put a wokeness veneer over the show,¡¨ he says. ¡§In the age of outrage, there are some things that people might take out of context and create a hurricane around, but they are what they are.¡¨There is a tendency for ¡§research-led¡¨ architectural exhibitions to end up feeling like a book stuck to the wall, and there is a danger the Guggenheim exhibition could fall into that trap. Therrien says that text will be a big part of the show, along with huge printed curtains and long ribbons of wallpaper that will wrap around many of the walls, with video screens showing documentary footage. There will also be a handful of roving robots, of the kind used in fulfilment centres, adorned with styrofoam cutouts intended to ¡§constantly throw the curatorial ball up in the air¡¨.Some who were involved in the project fear Koolhaas might have finally bitten off more than he can chew. ¡§It¡¦s problematic to call it ¡¥research¡¦,¡¨ says Charlotte Leib, a doctoral student at Yale, who was part of the exhibition¡¦s team when she was studying at Harvard. ¡§There are thousands of experts in these fields, and some of them were contacted, but it was a process of sculpting their findings towards the worldview of Rem.¡¨ Another research assistant is frank: ¡§It¡¦s symptomatic of architectural hubris that they take snapshots of a topic like this and present it to the world as ¡¥new¡¦.¡¨So what does Koolhaas want visitors to take away from his grand rural ramble? ¡§I¡¦ve always tried to put relevant issues on the architecture agenda,¡¨ he says. ¡§I am not thinking there should be more planning of the countryside, or that it is the next big place for architects to intervene.¡¨ His attraction to the megastructures of the industrialised hinterland is precisely because they have nothing to do with architects. They are ultra-utilitarian sheds, divorced from architectural ambition.¡§There is a danger of Midas in reverse, in terms of the consequences of architectural attention suddenly shifting to phenomena that were being developed innocently on their own,¡¨ he says. ¡§But I think it¡¦s more likely that architecture will change as a result of what¡¦s happening outside cities, rather than architects spoiling this new field.¡¨Koolhaas says his own practice has already been influenced by what he calls the ¡§post-human¡¨ architecture of the colossal sheds at TRIC and elsewhere, which he sees as embodying a kind of unparalleled purity. ¡§We are programmed to think that any ¡¥next¡¦ architecture can only be the outcome of a struggle,¡¨ he writes, in an exhibition catalogue essay. ¡§Modernism was born in a relentless campaign of stripping: of ornament, bourgeois values, frivolity. Because it takes place in the countryside, this is a stealth revolution ¡K The buildings here are not for humans but for things and machines. Thousands of years of architectural and cultural history are ditched.¡¨He describes OMA¡¦s new performing arts centre in Taipei, still under construction, as a result of this logic ¡V ¡§halfway between a building for humans and machinery¡¨. It incorporates a huge amount of back-of-house space for scenery and mechanisms to transform the auditoria in multiple configurations. The Factory, a new 130m venue being designed for Manchester, looks distinctly shed-like, and one wonders if OMA might be taking the ¡§post-human¡¨ idea a bit too literally, judging by the blank street frontage of its recent building for Brighton College.Koolhaas¡¦s exit from the city comes at a time when he seems increasingly detached from the built output of his practice. He keeps his own separate office in Amsterdam, away from the 300-strong team in Rotterdam, where he can concentrate away from the hubbub. There has been a restructuring of the partnership, so he is no longer the dominant overseeing principal, and OMA¡¦s buildings are now credited to the individual partners. He rarely attends the openings. Is this epic exhibition his swan song before quitting architecture?¡§Am I going to retire?¡¨ he barks, incredulously, before changing the subject to a new kind of tractor.',\n",
              " 'In the early 1970s, Stephen Shore made a series of large-format photographs of main streets in the US. He showed them to his friend and fellow photographer, Hilla Becher, one half of a rigorously formal German photographic duo with her husband, Bernd Becher. Nearly 50 years later, Shore can still remember her reaction. ¡§She looked at them and said: ¡¥So, Stephen, you want to photograph every main street.¡¦ I replied, ¡¥No, Hilla, that¡¦s what you want to do. I want to photograph the quintessential main street.¡¦¡¨To do that, Shore made several road trips across the country, photographing main streets, but also car parks, road signs, gas stations and shopfronts as well as the furniture in his rented motel rooms and the food he had for breakfast. The results appeared later in two influential photo books, Uncommon Places and American Surfaces. In them, Shore had captured not just the quintessential main street, but a quintessential America, both familiar and unsettling in its surface sameness. ¡§I wanted,¡¨ he says now, ¡§to somehow get to my perception of the underlying quality of the American landscape.¡¨Together, they amounted to a new topography of the vernacular American landscape, his style in places approximating what came to be known as the snapshot aesthetic, in other places adhering to a detached, almost neutral formalism that only added to the deadpan everydayness of his images. Shore later described his democratic approach thus: ¡§To see something ordinary, something you¡¦d see every day, and recognise it as a photographic possibility ¡V that¡¦s what I¡¦m interested in.¡¨ Though dismissed at the time by many critics, his style has been enduringly influential and he is now recognised as one of the greatest living photographers.His approach was singular, not least for the amount of thought he put into depicting the seemingly ordinary. ¡§I have always been interested in everyday experience,¡¨ he says, ¡§It relates to an idea I had back then of what it might be like to pay attention to the average moments in your life, rather than just the dramatic moments. Attentiveness is self-awareness ¡V you are aware of yourself paying attention. It was a different experience and I was nourished by it. I still am.¡¨While making the work that became Uncommon Places, Shore¡¦s attentiveness was further honed by his decision to use a large-format 8x10-inch camera. ¡§It¡¦s unlike any other camera,¡¨ he says. ¡§It¡¦s unwieldy. You have to physically lift it up on its tripod and move it to get the shot you want. That alone makes any decision you make very clear and visceral. The camera is no longer an extension of your eye; it¡¦s this tool that is outside of you.¡¨Perhaps for this reason, Shore also carried a small 35mm Leica on his travels, allowing him to shoot more freely and instinctively. Now, having finally revisited those long unseen images, he has produced a new photobook, Transparencies: Small Camera Works, 1971-1979. It is intriguing, not least because the America that emerges from it seems quintessentially Stephen Shore and yet somehow different: the style less formal, the tone more intimate and spontaneous.There is, too, a distinct aura that emanates from these pictures, a sense of another America, recognisable but distant, that seems at times luminous in its very everydayness. This is not just to do with time passing, but with the singular quality of the Kodachrome colour slide film he was using, which, according to Shore, ¡§is the sharpest film that Kodak ever made¡¨.It also allowed him to home in on illuminating details: an elaborately embossed cowboy boot, a garishly patterned tie, a pair of scuffed brown shoes discarded on a fading orange mat. He captured shadows falling on city streets and, in a single dramatic moment, a cloud of thick smoke billowing ominously over a country road. There are several snapshot-like pictures of bad art hanging in drab commercial interiors, as well as signage of every kind, from the makeshift to the stylish: an unfinished US that seems by turns charming and downbeat.Elsewhere, it seems as if the country is unfolding before him, a flow of fast-food joints, freeways, roadside stores and billboards. Did he set out, like Robert Frank before him, to look for the tarnished soul of America? ¡§Well, I was more fascinated by it than critical of it,¡¨ he says, ¡§I had no political axe to grind. I felt more like an explorer.¡¨For his first road trip, he tells me, laughing, he purchased a safari-style suit from Abercrombie & Fitch, which was then a traditional sporting and outdoors outfitter ¡V ¡§It was where you went if you were going on an African safari or fly fishing in Norway.¡¨ For his later trips, he wore a jump suit. ¡¨Back then,¡¨ he says, laughing, ¡§they just seemed to me like the right outfits to wear if you were going to drive around exploring America for three months with a camera.¡¨Did he draw much attention in his safari suit, lugging an old-fashioned plate camera on a tripod? ¡§Strangely, no,¡¨ he says. ¡§No one seemed to care at all that I was standing there, maybe six feet away, waiting for the light to change so I could photograph them. Often, they were more concerned when I was wandering about with the Leica. People would often chase me off their lawns and sidewalks.¡¨Shore¡¦s interest in photography began in childhood, when he was given a Kodak Junior darkroom set by a thoughtful uncle on his sixth birthday. He bought his first photography book, Walker Evans¡¦s classic American Photographs, aged 10, and, at 14, cold-called the esteemed Edward Steichen, curator of photography at Moma in New York, to ask whether he could show him some work. ¡§I didn¡¦t know you were not supposed to do that sort of thing,¡¨ Shore told me, laughing. His precociousness paid off, however, and Steichen purchased three photographs, though they have yet to be exhibited there.Shore¡¦s next port of call was Andy Warhol¡¦s Factory in New York. Having turned up unannounced, Shore hung out at the studio for three years, photographing between long bouts of ¡§sitting around on couches waiting for something to happen¡¨. In 1971, he became the first living photographer to have an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, showing a sequence of early black and white images. A year later, he arranged 200 unframed Kodak colour snapshots in grids on the walls of the city¡¦s Light gallery. The exhibition was met with bemusement and consternation from critics, visitors and other photographers, including Paul Strand, then in his 80s, who later told him that ¡§higher emotions could not be communicated in colour¡¨.Strand and Shore had conflicting views on the function of photography indicative of a wider generational shift in attitude ¡V a move away from traditional pictorialism towards new ways of seeing that embraced colour and the more knowing strategies of conceptual art.Before Shore embarked on the first of his many road trips, he made a tentative series of colour pictures in Union, New Jersey in 1971, six of which appear in Transparencies. In a way, they are a small, pivotal moment that prefigures the bigger one. ¡§They were all taken at funny angles like I was shooting out of a car window, which I wasn¡¦t,¡¨ he explains. ¡§What I was trying to do was take pictures that looked like they weren¡¦t composed. I wanted to get away from the visual conventions of photography, the weight of tradition that informed how you were supposed to structure a photograph. Basically, I wanted to take screwy pictures, but intentionally screwy pictures.¡¨Now aged 72, Stephen Shore is still interested in the possibilities of what might be called democratic photography. He posts a daily iPhone photo on Instagram, where he has 171,000 followers. Over the past few weeks, he has posted pictures of his dog, Wally, a cute Havanese, his compost, a frozen lake, ice-covered branches, a portrait of Debbie Harry and several snaps of the interior of his car.¡§It means I work every day,¡¨ he says. ¡§It can be diaristic or it can just be pictures I find interesting. I recently posted a picture of the steering wheel of my car and someone commented something along the lines of: ¡§Jeez, you¡¦ve finally run out of subject matter.¡¨ So, I replied: ¡¥Yep, that¡¦s it exactly.¡¦ I think most people understand my Instagram feed is not my gallery.¡¨In his 2017 Moma retrospective, he included three years of his Instagram pictures. ¡§People flew in from different parts of the world for the opening, he enthuses, ¡§and they all knew each other from Instagram. It¡¦s amazing in a way. I¡¦m interested in visual thinking, and there is something very personal and revealing about this kind of visual thinking that I just find fascinating.¡¨ Still curious, still engaged, Stephen Shore¡¦s way of seeing remains singular and defiantly democratic.',\n",
              " 'When Philippe Malouin was asked by Finnish glass manufacturer Iittala to create vessels that could be used to declutter people¡¦s living spaces, he began by taking a critical look at his own home.¡§I don¡¦t just have nice stuff ¡V I have ugly stuff, too,¡¨ admits the 39-year-old French-Canadian designer, who has lived in London since 2008 and runs his studio in Homerton, east London. ¡§Everyone has ugly stuff, like the remote control or that weird present your friend gave you. And since people of my generation live in smaller flats and have less storage, we need somewhere to put all this stuff.¡¨Malouin¡¦s rebuke to clutter is , a collection ¡V entitled Kuru, Finnish for ¡§gorge¡¨ ¡V of ¡§home displays¡¨. Spill the contents of your pockets into one of the grey or green pressed-glass key bowls, the idea goes, and things immediately start to look better.The Kuru collection may appear simple, but according to its designer it took two and a half years of hard work and to-ing and fro-ing to get right. Malouin, who was Wallpaper* magazine¡¦s designer of the year in 2018, has spent years honing his design approach, which he says favours ¡§a simple, geometric language that everyone can understand¡¨.Born in a small town in south-west Quebec, he studied industrial design at the University of Montreal before completing his bachelor¡¦s degree at the Design Academy Eindhoven. An internship with the British designer Tom Dixon brought him to London and soon afterwards he set up his studio, going on to create work for furniture companies SCP and Hem, and skincare brand Aesop. (Malouin, whose imposing height and bearded good looks belie a down-to-earth geniality, has also modelled menswear on the Prada catwalk.)This project was nostalgic for Malouin, as the first bit of serious design he ever bought was a set of Iittala glasses by Alfredo H?berli. He loved working closely with the company¡¦s glassblowers and ceramicists. ¡§Visiting factories and understanding the production capacities and problems, having discussions with manufacturing, is something we don¡¦t always get to do,¡¨ he says. ¡§This was really a hands-on, collaborative experience, which was great.¡¨The Kuru collection by Philippe Malouin starts from 40The EJR Barnes furniture business had practical beginnings: having moved into an unfurnished flat with nothing to sit on, Elliot Barnes decided to design his own seating. An autodidact who dropped out of art school, Barnes educated himself with the internet: ¡§I watched a video of a Hans Wegner chair being made,¡¨ he recalls, ¡§and found a forum post about a guy who made the same chair with hand tools. I figured that I could probably do something similar. The result was pretty wobbly and uncomfortable, carved from 2x4 pine with a chisel, but I had came to understand some of the mystery in making a chair.¡¨Barnes¡¦s approach is heartfelt, designing from need rather than want. Six years on from his plan to build his own furniture rather than buy mass-produced, he has a loyal fan base happy to pay a little more for his original works. Often his clean mid-century lines are disrupted by unusual material combinations; a classic surrealist trick M?eret Oppenheim used to perfectioned with her 1939 fur teacup. His aesthetic quest is to challenge reason and trigger poetic associations. ¡§I¡¦m very aware of how pretentious it is to make this type of ¡¥arty¡¦ furniture, and how privileged I am to be able to do so,¡¨ he admits. ¡§My natural defence is to mock it, as I do with almost everything else in my life.¡¨ Barnes is heavily influenced by ¡§the insane but also quite calming¡¨ work of Japanese designers Shiro Kuramata and Masaki Morita, and the idea of feeling being built into design. One of his pieces ¡V A Wild Sheep Chaise: Dolphin Hotel Club Chair, inspired by Haruki Murakami¡¦s novel A Wild Sheep Chase ¡V does exactly that. The chair is covered in woolly fabric, with an office blind on each side. ¡§I find these blinds quite beautiful and filmic but also ominous and claustrophobic, as they represent offices and meeting rooms and other terrors,¡¨ says Barnes.Despite the concepts, Barnes remains true to his roots: these are all pieces you could sit on in an unfurnished flat. ¡§If you can only look at something rather than use it,¡¨ he says, it quickly becomes invisible and impotent, I think.¡¨While many clothing brands scramble to sort out their supply chain and eco credentials, Ace & Jig celebrates 10 years of life as an environmentally aware, slow-fashion label that aims to produce zero waste and prolong the lifespan of their clothes. The Brooklyn-based company has an impressive history with their Indian textile workers, offering free childcare and fresh vegetables to staff (90% of whom are women). Their latest initiative is to foster Ace & Jig communities for customers by organising meet-ups. Join if you¡¦d like to resell old styles, clothes swap or pick up scrap fabrics for patching. For a recent project, customers worked together to make squares from scraps and create quilts. ¡§Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust¡¨ ¡V on a densely populated planet, it is hard to achieve this without serious environmental implications. It is not only our existence that is costing the earth, but also our demise. Traditional burials are the worst culprits, with toxic embalming fluids and copious concrete and timber usage. Cremations produce high carbon dioxide emissions and even natural burials, which are on the rise, require land.But what if we could swiftly and naturally become human compost that could nourish new life? This sustainable option will become a reality in Seattle in spring 2021, when the first Recompose facility offering ¡§natural organic reduction¡¨ opens in the city¡¦s SoDo neighbourhood. Washington State is the first US state to legalise this process, which uses one-eighth of the energy of cremation.Founder and CEO of Recompose, Katrina Spade, invented the system taking cues from farming methods used for recycling livestock. ¡§We¡¦re using nature ¡V which has perfected the life/death cycle ¡V as a model for human death care,¡¨ she says. ¡§We saw an opportunity to both give back to the earth and reconnect us with natural cycles.¡¨ Early prototypes were designed in collaboration with Olson Kundig, and now the Seattle-based architecture firm is transforming a 1960s-built warehouse into the inaugural 18,500 sq ft facility.The process is coffin-free. Corpses are wrapped in a cotton shroud and placed on a steel cradle filled with straw, wood chips and alfalfa. A ¡§laying-in¡¨ ritual follows that the family can attend, during which more of these ingredients are added, before the cradle slides into a hexagonal receptacle. Staff remove the shroud and seal the compartment to allow the 30-day process to begin.Renderings of Recompose: Seattle reveal a futuristic-like hive, with a central gathering space for ceremonies, surrounded by hexagonal-shaped storage for up to 75 bodies. The design deliberately references nature, ¡§specifically, the collective community of a beehive¡¨, says architect Alan Maskin, a principal of Olson Kundig. ¡§It has good structural properties, enabling us to vertically stack the vessels, which is important because Recompose¡¦s focus is on providing a sustainable death-care alternative for our cities, where space is at a premium.¡¨ After a month, the rich, dark, newly created soil is removed and can be donated to local forest conservation projects or taken home by relatives and used to plant new life. ¡§When you grow up in a place like Dhaka, you know something in the city is not right,¡¨ says Kazi Arefin, an architect who works in the Bangladeshi capital. Dhaka is a sprawling metropolis of extremes. In the centre, the rich hide from smoggy traffic jams in the back of air-conditioned cars, while the poor balance on the narrow seats of elaborately decorated cycle rickshaws. At the wrong time of day, a 10-minute journey can take hours.Arefin decided the best way to find a role for his work was to start a ¡§design and architecture studio focused on enhancing communities¡¨. The result was Paraa, founded in 2011 with urban planner and artist Ruhul Abdin. Their projects, often for charities, include training centres, children¡¦s homes and hospitals. Workers and residents are involved in the design from the start. This way, says Kazi, they ¡§feel ownership of a space and that the project suits their needs¡¨.When Paraa designed a homeless shelter in 2015, for example, they quickly found that the priorities of its users ¡V mainly women with children ¡V were not always the same as those of the charity running the project. The users ¡§wanted a space in which to play, to wash, to cook¡¨, says Paraa¡¦s co-founder, Ruhul Abdin. ¡§And lots of bathrooms!¡¨Managing and supporting these initiatives through good design can play a vital role in spotlighting the issues many city dwellers in Dhaka face. Paraa¡¦s 10m high Bamboo Playspace, which won a Berger award for excellence in architecture in 2017, shows how buildings can forge bonds.While the public structure is used by children across the local community, it is connected to Leedo Peace Home, a refuge for street children who are often disabled. ¡§It¡¦s become a bridge between those children who might otherwise be seen as troubled and local communities, who are now their friends.¡¨From the gate of their east London studio onwards, you get a sense of graphic designers Kirsty Carter and Emma Thomas¡¦ approach. Their agency name is written in letters sketched specifically for the metalwork, and produced according to the proportions of the golden ratio. The name spelt out is Apfel which stands for A Practice For Everyday Living, a nod to the title of French scholar Michel de Certeau¡¦s 1980 book, The Practice of Everyday Life.Carter and Thomas started the company in 2003, after meeting on the Royal College of Art¡¦s communication, art and design course. They were inspired by De Certeau¡¦s description of ¡§a way of making sense of a place by collecting materials, subverting existing patterns and drawing together new stories¡¨. As Carter says: ¡§We loved the connection of De Certeau¡¦s writing ¡K the references you gather from your daily rituals of everyday life.¡¨Now Apfel is the art world¡¦s favourite studio, working with institutions such as the Tate and individual artists, designing posters, art books, exhibition signage and invitations ¡V encompassing everything from the micro to the macro.Its breakthrough moment came in 2011, overseeing the visual identity for The Hepworth Wakefield, the museum dedicated to the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, creating new typefaces, signage and wayfinding, as well as website and permanent exhibition graphics. ¡§It was unusual for them to trust a single design agency, let alone one so young,¡¨ says Thomas. The project is typical of the space they like to work in: that intersection between art and design in areas involving what Carter describes as ¡§a closeness and a conversation: a sense of collaboration¡¨.This attention to detail is clear in all its projects. Apfel makes books and catalogues for Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes. All feature exposed binding, which echoes the stitching in Antunes¡¦ work. The packaging Apfel created for the shoe brand John Lobb has a speckled pattern inspired by the shavings and spatters found on the company¡¦s workshop floor.The duo seem particularly proud of their work creating artist monographs, which they have done for names including Lee Krasner, David Hockney and Jeremy Deller. ¡§Printed material is a space in the same way an exhibition is,¡¨ says Thomas. De Certeau couldn¡¦t have put it better.This week brought BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the delightful short film Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (if you¡¦re a Girl). The documentary features the amazing work of Skateistan. This not-for-profit organisation works in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa to give local children a safe space to develop. As well as learning to skateboard, children can access education, arts programmes and even clean water. The project was started by Australian Oliver Percovich in Kabul in 2007 when he moved there with his girlfriend. When he saw how much local teenagers enjoyed using the skateboards he lent them, he set up Skateistan. The organisation grew, opening Afghanistan¡¦s first skate park but also building classrooms so visitors could learn, too. Street workers were offered accelerated learning programmes so they could graduate to public school. Special classes for children with disabilities were also added, giving opportunities to girls to develop became a key mission. Skateistan has four schools ¡V in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Johannesburg, South Africa ¡V and this year a fifth is opening in Bamyan, central Afghanistan. Outreach workers are already in the area working with children to design their ideal skate schools ¡V spaces where they can be safe but also have fun.',\n",
              " 'Over the past decade, I¡¦ve been running a project space for emerging artists in east London called Guest Projects. Based just off Broadway Market, it supports practitioners in a variety of disciplines, from visual artists to musicians to theatre companies. Not long after setting it up in 2008, I decided I wanted to make the project international. As I have roots in Nigeria, and the creative scene there is so exciting, Nigeria seemed like the right place to do it.About eight years ago, I acquired some land in Lagos. Now we¡¦re in the process of building a residency in Lekki, a rapidly developing area in the east of the city. It will house three artists at a time, with studio and gallery spaces on the ground floor, and residents¡¦ bedrooms above.The project also extends to a 30-acre farm in Ijebu, three hours northeast of Lagos. We¡¦re in the process of landscaping and building a barn house and studios for artists, using sustainable materials such as mud, as well as a walled garden where people can learn about indigenous plants. Lagos is a very busy urban area with a lot of nightlife and music, so Ijebu will be for artists who need a more quiet space to produce work on a larger scale (there also will be a sculpture garden on the farm).The Guest Artists Space (G.A.S.) Foundation, as the new project is called, will be a two-way exchange. International visitors will be able to offer advice and support to local artists, but they will also receive knowledge. There¡¦s so much to learn in Africa, and so many amazing artists and intellectuals, and the project spaces will provide a platform for exchange, for debate, for collaboration. There will be opportunities for visitors to work alongside African artists, to debate alongside them, to explore work, and leave with a completely different perspective. I¡¦ve done residencies myself in the past and I always come back with a changed view of the world.African artists have always been there, doing fantastic work, and the rest of the world is only just catching up. When I was growing up in Nigeria in the 1970s, the music scene was incredible, thanks to artists such as Fela Kuti, and culture was very much part of my early experience. The arts suffered under the military regime in the 1980s and 90s, but Nigeria is more democratic now and the liberal arts are thriving again. The city has the Art X Lagos art fair, which draws collectors and artists from around the world. The middle class is growing and people have more disposable income. And there is still so much untapped potential. I see what¡¦s happening in Nigeria and across the continent as a kind of African renaissance.As well as facilitating cultural exchange and giving artists a space to work in, I want this project to support the local ecosystem and economy. In Ijebu, I have employed 12 farm workers, installed five greenhouses (growing tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables) and planted two acres each of maize, plantain and cassava. The point of all this is to help develop food security and sustainability in an area where unemployment is high and food supply is precarious. Bringing people to the farm, for arts events as well as residencies, should also provide a boost for the local economy.There have been challenges along the way. I¡¦ve learned that when you¡¦re doing a building project, you have to be extremely patient with things like planning permission. And when you set up a foundation, you have to listen to the board of trustees. You can¡¦t just go ahead and do things yourself, like you would in a studio.But the project is coming together. The farm is operational now and we should have the buildings and project spaces finished by the end of 2020. The building in Lagos will be ready by mid-2021 ¡V I may launch it to coincide with the art fair in November that year. And we¡¦ve got a very interesting, diverse range of trustees on our board, including artists El Anatsui, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, and Olafur Eliasson.As with the space in London, the residencies in Nigeria will be multi-disciplinary, rather than focusing narrowly on visual arts. Each residency will last three months, but we also want to offer long-term support for individual artists, equipping them to thrive not just survive, and I will be collaborating with other institutions and individuals to achieve that.International exchange has a very strong value, especially in a world where there¡¦s a great deal of conflict, and I believe that going to see other cultures, and being creative with other cultures, is really a very positive way forward. It can be a true vehicle for social change.',\n",
              " 'On Monday, Dior¡¦s haute couture show took place within the mighty womb of a female deity, created by formidable American artist Judy Chicago. Guests were seated within a custom version of an unrealised sculpture the influential feminist had first proposed in 1977 as Inflatable Mother Goddess. Chicago¡¦s proposition ¡§What If Women Ruled the World?¡¨ set the tone for a fashion collection inspired by proto-feminist heroines dating back to prehistory.Embroidered banners, three-metres high, posed follow-on questions: ¡§Would Buildings Resemble Wombs?¡¨ ¡§Would God Be Female?¡¨ ¡§Would There Be Violence?¡¨ ¡§Would Both Women and Men Be Gentle?¡¨ It was a spectacular backdrop for the fashion show, though Chicago pointed out that the sculpture and its hangings were more than that. ¡§We made art,¡¨ she told the New York Times.This is not the first time Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior, has looked to women artists for inspiration. For her second collection, models trod the runway in Breton tops embroidered with ¡§Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?¡¨ in tribute to art historian Linda Nochlin. Ever since, feminist art has been as much of a house signature as the bar jacket.The spring/summer 2018 couture show paid tribute to sexually upfront surrealist Leonor Fini. Last spring, ready-to-wear was shown surrounded by Italian gender provocateur Tomaso Binga¡¦s naked Mural Alphabets. The setting for the couture show last June was designed by the magnificently forthright and inventive Penny Slinger: the collection closed with a golden dress shaped like a doll¡¦s house in tribute to the British-born artist¡¦s psychologically charged work.These spectacular collaborations are not gimmicks. As an art nerd they may excite me, but I don¡¦t kid myself that the fashion world will necessarily thrill to collaborations with less-known octogenarian feminists. These are not easy or flippant references: internationally renowned, Chicago is a better-known exception among those whose work Chiuri has celebrated on the runway. For all, the Dior collaboration offered a wider audience ¡V and, I imagine, a welcome injection of cash toward the end of uncommercial careers. As Chicago has pointed out: ¡§It¡¦s no fun to be old and poor.¡¨Chiuri is to be congratulated. As the first female artistic director of Dior she has a highly visible public platform and is using it to celebrate work she is passionate about, and which she believes deserves a larger audience. Not only is she supporting women artists, whose work continues to be underrepresented in museum collections and undervalued at auction, in celebrating magnificent older women she resists the fashion world¡¦s obsession with youth.Is it weird for a feminist artist to work with a fashion brand? Only if you believe that fashion and feminism can¡¦t be bedfellows. Does fashion promote unrealistic beauty and body ideals? Yes, but no more so than social and network media. Does it engage in the oppression of women through reliance on a casual, unregulated workforce, much of it female? Often, yes. These are all wider social and industrial issues that need to be addressed on a wider social and industrial level. (Chicago¡¦s banners, incidentally, were made with the Chanakya School of Craft, a nonprofit organisation based in Mumbai.)Fashion is also about play, identity, challenging ideas of beauty, celebrating well-made things, sexual allure and the transmission of coded cultural messages. Chicago ¡V who sports violet hair, dark purple lipstick, sharp suits and eye-catching jewellery ¡V is not shy of the transformative effects of colour, form and beautifully crafted objects. She celebrates women as sexual beings, as creators, as mothers and caregivers, and has recently explored the process of ageing and the prospect of death with great frankness.The very reason that Nochlin felt the need to pose her question ¡§Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?¡¨ ¡V and by extension the reason that Chiuri has felt it important to celebrate women at Dior ¡V is that the art world has been, and continues to be, bedevilled by systemic prejudice, of which sexism is only one component. It seems to me no more anomalous for feminist artists to engage with the fashion world, for all its faults, than an art industry that has for decades failed to adequately engage with and value their contribution.The impulse to question the validity of support offered to one woman by another perpetuates a destructive ideal, according to which no feminist gesture can ever be adequate, no cultural contribution sufficiently pure. Cherish the support. Learn from it. Emulate it. As Nochlin wrote at the end of her famous essay: ¡§While great achievement is rare and difficult at best, it is still rare and more difficult if, while you work, you must at the same time wrestle with inner demons of self doubt and guilt, and outer monsters of ridicule.¡¨',\n",
              " 'The decades-long campaign to secure world heritage listing for Australia¡¦s largest collection of rock art has finally been taken to Unesco.The federal government on Friday lodged a submission for the Murujuga cultural landscape on Western Australia¡¦s Burrup Peninsula to be included on Australia¡¦s world heritage tentative list, the first formal step toward achieving global recognition for the 50,000-year-old gallery of more than one million petroglyphs.Peter Jeffries, the chief executive officer of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC), said the listing was ¡§thousands of years in the making¡¨.¡§Murujuga is a place of truly global significance and this is an important step in securing international awareness and protection of our incredible landscape and unique culture,¡¨ he said.MAC represents five clans who are traditional custodians, or Ngurra-ra Ngarli, for the Burrup Peninsula, and who have taken over its care since the Yaburara people, the traditional owners, were devastated by a massacre in the 1860s. Those groups are the Ngarluma, Mardudhunera, Yaburara, Yindjibarndi people and Wong-Goo-Tt-Oo peoples, but Jeffries said that MAC would ¡§welcome anyone with links to this special place to now participate in the world heritage nomination process alongside us¡¨.The WA Greens MP Robin Chapple, who has campaigned for world heritage listing for Murujuga since the 1980s, said he welcomed the decision but said the McGowan government was undermining its efforts to secure a world heritage listing by not moving faster to curb emissions from heavy industry on the Burrup Peninsula, which have caused damage and discolouration of some petroglyphs.¡§It will be very interesting to see how the government can manage the process of world heritage nomination at the same time as increasing industry on the Burrup,¡¨ Chapple said.Establishing a formal monitoring program for potentially damaging emissions is part of the WA government¡¦s rock art strategy. MAC and the Department of Water and Environment Regulation are currently assessing tender applications for a monitoring program and a government spokesman says it is ¡§anticipated that a contract will be awarded shortly¡¨.The largest industrial emitter on the peninsula, gas giant Woodside, received approval from the Environmental Protection Authority in WA to build a 434km pipeline from the Scarborough gas field near Broome to its processing facility on the Burrup Peninsula, extending the life of that facility by 25 years.The EPA¡¦s consideration of the full expansion project, which Woodside says will create almost 5,000 jobs in construction and 2,000 ongoing jobs, and boost Australia¡¦s GDP by 414bn between 2019 and 2063, is open for public comment until 12 February.¡§It¡¦s going to be very, very difficult to say to the world heritage committee that industry and the rock art can coexist,¡¨ Chapple said. ¡§We know the increased acidity from emissions is already starting to damage the rock art.¡¨Judith Hugo, the co-convener of Friends of Australian Rock Art, said it was ¡§completely farcical¡¨ to nominate Murujuga for world heritage listing while also encouraging further industrial development on the peninsula.The WA environment minister, Stephen Dawson, said there was a ¡§a broad level of support from stakeholders, including industry and the local community, for world heritage listing¡¨.The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said she was proud to support the nomination.¡§Murujuga, which includes the Dampier Peninsula and surrounds, has the largest, densest and most diverse concentrations of petroglyphs in the world,¡¨ Ley said.The submission will be considered when the world heritage committee meets in Fuzhou, China, in June and July this year.If the submission is accepted it has to sit on the tentative list for at least 12 months before the listing is formalised.However, because Australia currently sits on the world heritage committee, and has promised not to progress any of its own listings until that term is up, the earliest that Murujuga could be formally added to the world heritage list is 2022.',\n",
              " 'It was billed as one of the most inclusive opportunities for architects in history, a bold open call for emerging talents to be given the chance to win public-sector projects ¡V the holy grail of any aspiring young practice. Southwark council declared that its New Architect Design Services Framework was a ¡§first-of-a-kind¡¨ attempt to engage with a new generation of diverse designers. As councillor Leo Pollak put it: ¡§It is the framework some architects have been waiting for all their years.¡¨It turns out that black architects will have to wait even longer. Out of the 110 architecture firms selected for the panel, with the chance to bid for 100m of fees from public sector clients over the next four years, not a single one of them is led by a black architect. It would be an alarming result in any context, but it is particularly stark in a London borough that has the largest black African population in the country, and where over a quarter of residents identify as black. ¡§The outcome was entirely predictable,¡¨ says one black architect based in Southwark, who applied for the panel. ¡§They didn¡¦t even shortlist a black practice, and they haven¡¦t ever done so in the past. It¡¦s the same across London. Almost no black child can see anybody that looks like them be appointed to design so much as a park bench in their borough.¡¨For this architect, who asked to remain anonymous, the result is merely the latest frustrating episode in a long history of exclusion. Having grown up on a Southwark council estate and studied architecture at a university in the borough, he now has two decades of experience in practice, including working on RIBA award-winning housing schemes, and has engaged with councils across London for years to encourage them to widen the net. Yet he finds his applications for public work are rarely even considered. ¡§It¡¦s the result of generations of unconscious bias ingrained into the system,¡¨ he says.Southwark insists that its assessment process was entirely ¡§applicant-blind¡¨, and that more than half of its evaluation panel was made up of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people. A council spokesperson said: ¡§The framework consciously sought to remove the barriers that limit the variety of skills and perspectives available to use on public sector projects, and is the first framework of its kind to remove insurance and turnover thresholds and forward-evaluate smaller practices ie, allow them to submit unbuilt work.¡¨ Southwark says that several open webinar sessions were held with architects to help shape the evaluation criteria, and that its Fairer Futures Commitments were used in the selection process. Yet, of the several black-led practices that applied, not a single one was even shortlisted.In the eyes of quantity surveyor Bola Abisogun, founder of Urbanis, the result reflects an endemic problem across the sector. ¡§Public authorities have failed miserably,¡¨ he says. ¡§Why is it that, in areas where councils have an overwhelming number of non-white business owners, their procurement process excludes that very same demographic?¡¨Abisogun has long battled to increase diversity in the construction industry. He chaired the 2010 Equality and Human Rights Commission¡¦s inquiry into race discrimination in construction and produced a report on procurement reforms in 2013. But he feels his recommendations keep falling on closed ears. ¡§Councils keep defaulting to the same processes,¡¨ he says. ¡§The biggest mistake is that they have outsourced their intelligence, relying on advisers to tell them everything. Internally, they have no capacity to understand if what they¡¦re being told is right.¡¨In Southwark¡¦s case, the architecture framework was administered by procurement specialist LHC. When challenged over discrimination, LHC responded: ¡§As standard practice LHC do not currently collate information on any of the characteristics of the organisations bidding for our frameworks ¡V to do so would be difficult for us to ensure no prejudice is made during evaluation.¡¨In many critics¡¦ eyes, the failure to collect this data is precisely the problem. Without knowing who they are doing business with, how can a council ever hope to ensure it has a diverse base of suppliers? UK public authorities spend about 300bn each year on buying goods and services from other organisations across every sector, a figure that is set to grow as the government plans to build its way out of economic collapse. If all of that money went to white-owned businesses, we would have no way of knowing.¡§Imagine trying to bring down carbon emissions without counting the level of carbon emissions,¡¨ says the Southwark-based architect. ¡§Public authorities say they¡¦re trying to increase the diversity of their suppliers, but they¡¦re not even measuring it.¡¨To prove his point, he lodged a freedom of information request with every London borough in 2016 to determine if any of them had ever employed a black architect. None of them could say that they had. The Guardian recently contacted a number of councils and received the same response. ¡§How rarely councils trade with diverse suppliers remains usefully opaque,¡¨ says the architect, ¡§whereas they have infinite granular detail on which ethnicities collect which benefits. We are seen as the needy client group ¡V as takers not makers.¡¨¡§Bureaucrats get incredibly lazy about this,¡¨ says Elsie Owusu, a leading black architect who has spoken out against discrimination for decades. ¡§Their processes are all focused on anticipating criticism, rather than thinking, ¡¥What communities are we trying to serve?¡¦ There has to be a better understanding of what delivering high-quality architecture to a socially disadvantaged community really means.¡¨As another black architect argues, when it comes to shaping the built environment, diversity leads to better outcomes. ¡§This is everyone¡¦s issue,¡¨ she says. ¡§It¡¦s about making better places for everyone, designed by people who consider factors that others might not. Society is made up of people with very different needs, so there is a lot more to offer if you have that lived experience in the room.¡¨The notion of an inclusive system for spending huge amounts of taxpayers¡¦ money is not just an aspiration; it is a legal duty. The 2010 Equality Act bestows all local authorities with the public sector equality duty, a requirement to consider how their policies affect minority groups, including having ¡§due regard¡¨ to the need to minimise disadvantages and encourage participation.John Halford, a leading human rights lawyer, has successfully litigated a number of cases where public bodies have failed to discharge their equality duties, or practised indirect discrimination.¡§When it comes to procurement, councils should be looking very carefully at their rules and thresholds,¡¨ he says. ¡§For example, if you had a rule to only accept architecture practices that have been established for 30 years, or have completed projects of a certain value, then that rule superficially seems non-discriminatory in terms of race and gender. But, obviously, if you look at the demographics of architecture firms, you quickly see that such a rule might exclude most BAME- or women-led practices that have been established more recently, or worked on smaller projects. Criteria might appear to be race-neutral on paper, but when you actually test them against the demographics of the industry, they¡¦re going to have a discriminatory effect.¡¨Halford stresses that, under the Equality Act, simply having an open tender is not good enough. Councils have a duty to actively encourage applications from under-represented groups, too. ¡§In a situation that has historically had lower BAME representation, you would expect the procurement exercise to take positive steps to encourage those groups to apply in the first place,¡¨ he says. ¡§It should be a process where you look to see whether there are equality problems in the way you have done things historically, and how you might do them differently in future.¡¨The mayor of London has condemned the outcome of Southwark¡¦s framework as ¡§clearly unacceptable¡¨, yet Southwark insists that it followed the mayor¡¦s own procurement guidelines for equality, diversity and inclusion. The mayor launched his own Architecture, Design and Urbanism Panel in 2018, but, when questioned by the Guardian, a spokesperson declined to confirm how many BAME- or black-led practices are on it. ¡§Innovatively for the time, 5% of the scoring was awarded to bidders based on their understanding and commitment to diversity,¡¨ they said in a statement, ¡§but unfortunately that still failed to achieve the wider community representation we were seeking.¡¨Southwark councillor Leo Pollak says he is frustrated by the low number of BAME-led practices on the council¡¦s framework, but he places the blame on the nature of the architecture profession itself. ¡§In spite of architects from all walks of life working on our council housing schemes,¡¨ he says, ¡§we know that our design pool still too far reflects the wider systemic issues in the profession that limit the cultural diversity of its practitioners.¡¨ Writing in the Architects¡¦ Journal, Pollak is critical of an industry that is mired in ¡§long and expensive training, exclusionary language, slow efforts to decolonise the Eurocentric curriculums in many design schools ¡K not to mention an embarrassing and antiquated ¡¥old boys¡¦ culture that still persists¡¨.All of this is true, but some suggest such thinking does a disservice to the minority-led practices that have succeeded against the odds. ¡§People say black architects simply don¡¦t exist,¡¨ says one, ¡§or if they do exist, they¡¦re not good enough. We are most definitely here, we¡¦re just asking to be given a chance.¡¨Ye?m? ?l?d?run, an architect who moved from private practice to work for a housing association, has experienced the situation from both sides. ¡§Now I am on the client side, I do understand how much risk these public bodies are having to take,¡¨ she says. ¡§You naturally want to go with the guys who have been around for ever and have the massive professional indemnity insurance ¡V the safe pair of hands who have done it 20 times before. But that means the new architects coming up are never given a chance.¡¨When she saw how many black architecture students who came after her struggled to find jobs, she co-founded Paradigm, a professional network aimed at increasing BAME representation in the built environment, and has been a mentor for the Social Mobility Foundation and the Fluid Diversity Mentoring Programme. ¡§I¡¦ve been lucky,¡¨ she says. ¡§I have been rewarded professionally for working hard, but I know many who are just as industrious but see no progression. I¡¦ve seen black students come out with first-class degrees and they still can¡¦t get an interview. If you¡¦ve done your Part 1 the first three-year degree of the architecture course and can¡¦t get any work, why would you go back to do your Part 2, let alone your Part 3 the professional qualification?¡¨The most recent education statistics from the RIBA show that, while 6.4% of applicants to undergraduate architecture degree courses are black, they make up only 5.2% of accepted students. By the time it gets to Part 3, black students achieving the qualification make up only 2.7% of the cohort (87.9% are white), while the number of black registered architects in the UK is just 1% of the total.One established architecture tutor, who has taught at a number of former polytechnics, which tend to have a higher number of BAME students, despairs at the systematic racism she has witnessed.¡§It¡¦s like a toxic cult,¡¨ she says. ¡§One of my brightest students couldn¡¦t even get a job interview because he had an African name, so he ended up leaving architecture to work at Asda. Others have gone into web design or tech. If you want to be successful and earn some money as a black person, why on earth would you stick with architecture?¡¨Once they have qualified, the chances of career progression are also stacked against them. As architecture student Shawn Adams told the Guardian: ¡§You don¡¦t see black people in higher positions in practice. You go into it assuming that the sky¡¦s the limit, but there¡¦s this glass ceiling. If you go beyond and try to do too much, you¡¦re seen as a problem. If you conform to the norm and try not to be the best, you¡¦ll be fine.¡¨Brothers Akil and Seth Scafe-Smith came to working in the built environment through a different route, so can see the peculiarities of the architecture profession through an alternative lens. Akil studied urban design, while Seth had worked in project management, before they co-founded the Resolve Collective with Gameli Ladzekpo, an interdisciplinary design practice that combines architecture, engineering, technology and art to address social challenges.¡§Architecture is so behind on the conversation,¡¨ says Akil, who spent a year in a council urban design department, where he was the only black employee on his team. ¡§We work a lot with art galleries, and there are still vast inequalities in the art world, but there is much more openness to talking about these issues.¡¨ Recently the collective held a public architecture event on Zoom, which had to stop short after it was hijacked by racist abuse.Seth, who also works for a London borough, stresses the value of including those without conventional architecture training in the conversation. ¡§Shaping the built environment requires so much more than people who have a single set of skills,¡¨ he says. ¡§It¡¦s about looking through other lenses, and how that local knowledge is valued and accessed. Local authorities need to commit more time to understanding what they already have in their area, and how their own communities can support and inspire them to do things in a better way.¡¨Many feel the time is long overdue for positive action. For Abisogun, the terms of the Equality Act and the recommendations of countless reports have simply failed to have any lasting impact. Data on ethnicity was collected for a short time, but it was soon scrapped as ¡§red tape¡¨. He points to the example of the United States where, following the civil rights movement in the 1960s, a number of states adopted the principle of ¡§set aside¡¨ contracts for minority-owned businesses. ¡§The UK is still missing a trick,¡¨ he says. ¡§A lot of people didn¡¦t realise that across the world there are strategies and policies in place in an attempt to level up.¡¨Under the set-aside policy, a city can declare that a percentage of the total value of a contract must go to companies owned by a member of a minority group. The City of Atlanta, Georgia, for example, mandates that 27% of construction contracts must go to minority businesses, while the federal government has a goal to award at least 5% of federal contracts to small disadvantaged businesses each year.Such a policy would be incompatible with UK and EU law as it stands, and there have been questions about its merits and effectiveness. ¡§There is a big, never-resolved debate about whether the principle of quotas is a good thing or a bad thing,¡¨ says Halford, ¡§about whether the role of the law is to eliminate discrimination as far as possible, or to rebalance historical injustices. Until there is a correct balance, the law needs to push for proper representation.¡¨Southwark borough¡¦s spokesman says: ¡§We still have far to go. A lack of diversity in any of our frameworks will not be fixed overnight, but it is something we are determined to continue to inject the energy, resources and time needed to see a positive change.¡¨¡§We¡¦re just asking for a level playing field,¡¨ says the Southwark-based architect. ¡§This feels like a powerful moment to demand real change, and I¡¦m optimistic we can turn the tide. After all, no black architect has got to where they are without being tenacious.¡¨',\n",
              " 'If you look skyward on the fourth of July in the United States, you can usually expect to see fireworks burst forth above towns and cities as people celebrate Independence Day.This year, in the sunny skies above the land of the free, the loaded question of independence ¡V for whom, and on whose terms? ¡V was brought into clear focus by sky-typing planes that wrote messages including ¡§CARE NOT CAGES¡¨, ¡§ABOLISH ICE¡¨ and ¡§ESTOY AQUI¡¨ (¡§I¡¦m here¡¨) above detention facilities, immigration courts, borders, and historically significant sites in dozens of cities across the US.The messages were part of In Plain Sight, an artwork by a coalition of 80 artists and activists. Over the course of a number of weeks, these messages will be delivered to the sky by two fleets of five planes. Founded by the interdisciplinary artists Cassils and rafa esparza, In Plain Sight is as ambitious in its scale as it is in its intention: working towards the abolition of immigrant detention and the US culture of incarceration.¡§I was shocked to learn that there are over 50,000 people in detention at any given moment, and that this is a for-profit industry,¡¨ says Cassils, who is Canadian but lives in Los Angeles.¡§This is a humanitarian crisis. And it¡¦s hiding in plain sight, thus the title. The idea is to really use the skywriting as a way of piercing through electoral politics, to focus on the fact that this is not a partisan issue.¡¨There¡¦s poetry to the skyward messages of In Plain Sight. It is literally visible, perhaps through windows of detention facilities, by the people whose liberation the action works towards. But it also recalls both the patriotic messages and ¡§red, white and blue¡¨ smoke plumes that are daubed across the sky on 4 July.Delivered by a method usually used to advertise car sales or insurance, In Plain Sight brings to mind the work of other artists who have harnessed the language of advertising, but does so in a uniquely 21st century fashion; it¡¦s not just a shareable, photogenic action, but one that has an ¡§impact team¡¨ ¡V led by the organiser, Set Hernandez Rongkilyo ¡V working to ensure the message lingers. In this way, the artists behind In Plain Sight hope to push the viewer¡¦s experience of the artwork beyond contemplation and into direct action.¡§Oftentimes this speculative space that exists between an artwork and its reception by the viewer is filled with the hope that something generative is experienced by the viewer,¡¨ esparza explains, saying the artists wanted to ¡§make something that can be of service to organisations that have been seeking justice for immigrant folks in detention for decades¡¨.Sky-typing may appear, upon first glance, to be an ephemeral mode of performance (albeit one that can reach around 3 million people with each message), but the work will live on via the free Augmented Reality app 4th Wall: users will be able to see the messages floating in the sky above key locations they visit.The hashtag #XMAP directs viewers to the accompanying website, xmap.us, allowing viewers intrigued by the heavenly messages to see, via geolocation, the detention facilities in their town. They will also be able to donate to local bond funds and engage with the 17 immigrant justice organisations involved ¡V such as ACLU Southern California, RAICES, and Freedom for Immigrants ¡V and their work being done on the ground.The coalition of activists and artists involved is nearly as jaw dropping as the scale of the work, including former minister of culture for the Black Panther party, Emory Douglas, the Cree artist Kent Monkman, the conceptual artist Mary Kelly, the writer and performance artist ALOK Vaid-Menon and the revolutionary artist Dread Scott.The Aboriginal Australian cross-disciplinary artist and writer SJ Norman contributed the message ¡§NO SUCH PLACE¡¨ (the literal meaning of ¡§utopia¡¨), which appeared over the Laredo detention center in Texas. ¡§When Indigenous peoples speak the names of our nations we are frequently told, implicitly or explicitly, there¡¦s no such place,¡¨ Norman said in the artist¡¦s statement. ¡§The maintenance of the colonial project is contingent on atrocity and the perpetration of atrocity is largely contingent on denial. Settlers live with the ancestrally coded fear of losing what they know they stole in the first place.¡¨Indeed, many Australians who shared the In Plain Sight images on social media were quick to note Australia¡¦s significant rates of Aboriginal deaths in custody, incarceration and immigration detention ¡V such as the former Manus Island detainees now being held in Melbourne¡¦s Mantra Hotel ¡V and how the inhumanity of such policies is magnified by the Covid-19 crisis.The artists hope that as the messages fade from the sky, they will inspire in viewers a desire to bring about change. ¡§We knew it was ephemeral, but the quickness with which the wind erased the cloud really for me spoke to the moment we¡¦re in currently,¡¨ Cassils says. ¡§We have a brief moment of clarity ¡V with Covid, with uprisings, there¡¦s momentum that¡¦s building ¡V but we must act now, we must be relentless, we cannot give up.¡¨The final fleets of planes will head to the skies in the coming weeks. Above the Statue of Liberty, where Emma Lazarus¡¦s inscribed sonnet ¡V ¡§Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free¡¨ ¡V came to symbolise the hopefulness of immigration to the US, Dread Scott¡¦s message will float in the sky. It will read ¡§Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mejia¡¨, the name of the first immigrant to die in US detention from Covid-19.',\n",

However, The Architects¡¦ Journal last week revealed that several new Foster and Partners projects in Saudi Arabia have caused controversy in the profession over their links to the aviation industry.Last year the practice won the design contract for an airport for a luxury resort, known as the Red Sea Project, in Saudi Arabia. And last month it was also revealed that it had put forward a proposal to build a terminal and control tower to serve a similar project: the Amaala luxury resort.Amaala is described as being ¡¥akin to a private members¡¦ club¡¦ and is currently being built on a 400,000 hectare site along Saudi Arabia¡¦s north-west coast. The resort¡¦s airport could be used by up to 1 million passengers a year after the resort¡¦s opening, currently scheduled for 2023.Foster¡¦s involvement in these projects has infuriated climate-concerned architects who joined Foster in signing the Architects Declare manifesto to ¡§raise awareness of the climate and biodiversity emergences and the urgent need for action¡¨. The manifesto also called for the establishment of ¡§climate and biodiversity mitigation principles as the key measures of our industry¡¦s success¡¨.Helping the aviation industry to expand runs counter to these aspirations, warns a group of architects, the Architects Climate Action Network (Acan), who have demanded an explanation from Foster and Partners over its plans. The campaign group says the Saudi projects run counter to its declared commitment to protect the planet against the current climate change crisis being triggered by rising carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning. The group has also announced it will be pressing all UK architecture practices to end involvement with the aviation industry.¡§Anything that encourages the expansion of the aviation industry and the associated rise in the burning of fossil fuel should be viewed as being off-limits for architects concerned about the rate at which our planet is warming,¡¨ said a spokesperson for Acan. ¡§It is as simple as that. We should be working to bring about a moratorium on the expansion of air travel.¡¨Foster and Partners is famous for his design of spacious, sleek steel and glass buildings. These include London¡¦s St Mary Axe building, popularly known as The Gherkin; City Hall, London; and the Great Court in the British Museum. Contacted by the Observer last week, Foster and Partners said it would not be responding to the criticisms made against them by campaigners.',\n",
              " 'Wouldn¡¦t it be a relief ¡V considering we are all stuck inside and travel is a distant memory ¡V if you could get a change of scenery? A new view would do us all well, and with that in mind, people across the world ¡V from Beirut, to the French Antilles, to Hawaii ¡V have been making short videos of what¡¦s right outside their windows to share so we can still explore during quarantine.See someone¡¦s world from their window in Oxford, Michigan, where the reflection of emerald trees bounces off the water. See potted plants dance in the breeze in Honolulu. If it¡¦s chaos you¡¦re craving, opt for the busy bustling road in London¡¦s Brixton, where red buses and white vans hurry past tower blocks seemingly unaware of the menacing dark cloud hovering above.Sonali Ranjit and Vaishnav Balasubramaniam started the WindowSwap project while under lockdown in Singapore by asking a few close friends to share the view from their windows with them. In June they expanded it, asking people to send in 10 minutes of horizontal video via email, to be uploaded on their website. They have received hundreds of submissions from dozens of countries across the world since. ¡§Until we can explore our planet responsibly again I guess, this is a way to travel without moving,¡¨ says Ranjit over the telephone from Singapore.They have made small discoveries since then, like the ability to trade places for a moment with people in places they had never heard of; seeing the view of an 81-year-old woman in Massachusetts who couldn¡¦t send a video because she didn¡¦t know how, but sent a beautiful photo instead; understanding the natural knack of teenagers in cities for making high-quality videos; and nothing quite compares to the appeal of a slightly pixellated, grainy video from a small town.¡§I feel, they have so much character and it¡¦s the beauty of this thing we started, that continues to transform,¡¨ says Balasubramaniam.',\n",
              " 'The Conservative government has a known mistrust of experts, but rarely do ministers fly in the face of their own commissioned research as starkly as the housing secretary did this week. On the very same day that Robert Jenrick triumphantly extended permitted development rights (PDR), allowing a range of building types to be converted into housing without planning permission, his own ministry published a report condemning the same rules for leading to ¡§worse quality¡¨ homes.After studying hundreds of new homes carved out from converted offices, shops, warehouses and industrial buildings, created between 2015 and 2018 through permitted development, a team of academics from University College London and the University of Liverpool found predictably grim results. The planning loophole had unleashed a new breed of tiny, dingy apartments, many barely fit for human habitation, with rooms accessed from long corridors, windows looking across internal atriums into other people¡¦s rooms, and some bedrooms with no windows at all.The research found that only 22% of dwellings created through permitted development met the nationally described space standards, compared with 73% of units created with full planning permission. They frequently came across studio apartments of as little as 16 square metres, less than half the size of the national standard of 37 sq m. Their research also found that the homes were eight times more likely to be located in the middle of a business park or industrial estate, while only 3.5% had access to outdoor space. Buildings converted to homes through permitted development, the researchers concluded, ¡§do seem to create worse quality residential environments than planning permission conversions in relation to a number of factors widely linked to the health, wellbeing and quality of life of future occupiers¡¨.The academics submitted their findings in January, so it has come as a surprise that, six months later, the housing secretary has decided not to rein in permitted development rights, but extended them even further. It is particularly charged timing, given that planning rules are being relaxed in the name of ¡§delivering additional homes more easily as part of the government¡¦s response to the Covid-19 pandemic¡¨. At a time when the need for decent quality domestic space has been amplified, and the dangers of overcrowding magnified, the government is only making it easier for cramped, substandard homes to be built. Adding to frustrations over the delay, the new measures were announced one day before the parliamentary summer recess, and buried by the news of a damning report on Russia¡¦s possible interference in the Brexit referendum.¡§The new legislation fundamentally undermines the notion of a democratic, professional and accountable planning system,¡¨ says Dr Ben Clifford, professor at UCL¡¦s Bartlett School of Planning, who co-led the research. ¡§Not only will it continue to produce more tiny flats with poor living conditions, but it also means the developers are not required to provide any affordable housing or make any contributions to local infrastructure, like parks and playgrounds. It¡¦s placing a huge burden on local communities, while at the same time making more profit for developers.¡¨Since 2015 more than 60,000 flats have been created through permitted development in England, with almost 90% coming from office conversions, representing a loss of tens of thousands of affordable homes, according to Shelter. ¡§We were astounded,¡¨ says Robin White of the housing charity, in response to the new legislation. ¡§This is a far cry from the prime minister¡¦s promise to Build Back Better. And a far cry from the good quality, affordable social homes that this country so desperately needs.¡¨ Even the government¡¦s own Building Better, Building Beautiful commission concluded that permitted development had inadvertently created ¡§future slums¡¨.The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Alan Jones, describes the extensions of the policy as ¡§disgraceful¡¨, leading to more homes with rooms that will be ¡§smaller than in budget hotels¡¨. ¡§There is no evidence that the planning system is to blame for the shortage of housing,¡¨ he says, ¡§and plenty to suggest that leaving local communities powerless in the face of developers seeking short-term returns will lead to poor results.¡¨In what represents the most drastic change to permitted development rights since the planning system was introduced after the second world war, the legislation opens the door for a new generation of rabbit-hutch homes to proliferate unchecked. If an office or industrial building built before 1990 has been vacant for six months, it may now be demolished and replaced with a house or apartment block, without any planning scrutiny. Another amendment allows an additional two residential storeys to be added on top of existing buildings, while a third change combines everything from shops and restaurants, to gyms, health facilities, nurseries, offices and light industrial buildings into a single use class. As Rob McNicol, principal strategic planer at the Greater London Authority, tweeted: ¡§This matters because you will now no longer need planning permission to change between these uses. The changes unpick a decades-long approach to planning for town centre uses. It is an untested nationwide experiment in laissez-faire town centre management.¡¨As Guardian investigations have shown, the substandard homes created by permitted development are often used to house society¡¦s most vulnerable members, including as temporary accommodation for families on housing waiting lists. Harlow in Essex, where half the new homes created in 2018/19 came from office conversions, has become a particular flashpoint for the planning loophole. The buildings have seen incidents of domestic abuse, suspected drug dealing, alcohol-fuelled bad behaviour and reports of children who are frightened to go home and can¡¦t sleep at night because they are ¡§petrified¡¨. Harlow¡¦s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, has described the policy as ¡§a disaster¡¨. ¡§If there are not proper controls on quality,¡¨ he said, ¡§and developers are allowed to build ghettos for people on the lowest incomes then we will have a repeat of what we¡¦ve had in the first wave of permitted development.¡¨Harlow is not alone. Clifford¡¦s research has highlighted a range of shocking examples, such as Central House and Maplehurst House in Crawley, which both contain 16-sq-m studio flats, some with no windows. Then there are the converted business parks, including New Horizons Court in Brentford, where 25 flats have windows just facing the central atrium space, 10m across from their neighbours, or the Central Business Centre in Neasden, with 20 studio flats sandwiched between a cement works and the North Circular Road. The largest permitted development project in the country is currently under way at the Parkview office campus in Bristol, which will see 467 flats created in a former supermarket headquarters, one building described on the architects¡¦ own website as ¡§doomed to be the housing complex¡¨.Julia Park, head of housing research at Levitt Bernstein architects, produced a report last year documenting a number of the worst examples of housing spawned by permitted development. She despairs at the latest legislation. ¡§The government hasn¡¦t learned anything from what office-to-residential conversions have produced so far,¡¨ she says. ¡§The new rights will just lead to more of the same¡¨. While the latest amendments include a requirement for ¡§adequate natural light¡¨ in all habitable rooms, there¡¦s no detail on what that actually means. ¡§We¡¦ve seen whole flats, and hundreds of habitable rooms that only have borrowed light from an internal atrium so have no view to the outside. Is that ¡¥adequate¡¦?¡¨ As Park¡¦s report noted: ¡§Building regulations have never required a living space to have a window, not because it doesn¡¦t matter, but because no one imagined that anyone would offer a home without one.¡¨ The regulations, it seems, were written in more innocent times, before the planning system was dismantled and our cities opened up to the market at any cost. Even the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a powerful lobby group for the development sector, concurs: ¡§Overall, office to residential PDR has been a fiscal giveaway from the state to the private real estate interests,¡¨ their 2018 report concluded (Pdf), ¡§while leaving a legacy of a high quantum of poor quality housing.¡¨Park points out that permitted development rights have created a Kafkaesque situation whereby local authorities do not have the power to stop substandard homes being built, but they may be able to have them shut down once they are occupied. Through existing powers set out in the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, councils can serve an enforcement notice on any home that poses a severe risk to health, with insufficient internal space being among the recognised hazards. Park, who has been working with Leeds City Council to clamp down on a spate of very small flats, also has no doubt that a significant number of the new homes created through permitted development pose a serious hazard to mental health, and are therefore unfit for human habitation under the Fitness for Human Habitation Act, which came into force in March 2019. Shelter has also been advocating use of the act, although it cautions that it is not the solution. ¡§We should not be relying on this act to fix fundamental quality and safety issues with housing that was created at most six years ago,¡¨ the charity said. ¡§It goes without saying that these houses should have been up to scratch in the first place ¡V which they would have been if they had the proper quality checks from the outset.¡¨',\n",
              " 'In Andy Warhol¡¦s film Chelsea Girls, Brigid Berlin sits cross-legged issuing commands. ¡§Donnie, comb it a little. Come here and give it a poke. Get the brush, the spray and all my tools,¡¨ she says as she sweeps a hand through her bouffant do. Her tone is haughty but her words slur slightly as she goes on to inject herself in the backside with amphetamines.In the script Warhol refers to Berlin¡¦s character as ¡§The Duchess¡¨. Berlin, who has died aged 80, was playing only a barely fictionalised version of herself in the 1966 art film. She came from the kind of blue blood money that Warhol only dreamed of, but swapped the aristocratic life of the Upper East Side for the creative slums of downtown Chelsea, becoming a muse to the pop artist, starring in several of his films, as well as being a constant companion, collaborator and documentarian.In her own right she carved out a career as an artist ¡V though she refused the label ¡V that incorporated performance, sculpture, Polaroid photography assiduously recording her raucous milieu, and a series of paintings made by dipping her breasts in paint and smearing them on paper to produce multi-hued orbs.On stage at the Bouwerie Lane theatre in January 1968, performing a long-running act Brigid Polk Strikes! (using her nickname Polk), Berlin lay in a makeshift bed calling friends on the telephone, broadcasting the conversation unbeknown to the person on the other end. She told one victim, Huntington Hartford, the heir to the A&P supermarket fortune, that she desperately needed money for an abortion. When he agreed to help her out, Berlin left the stage and jumped in a cab, returning to the theatre triumphantly waving the wad of dollars he had given her.Her sculpture, which came much later, featured stuffed pillows decorated with penises. ¡§Brigid would cut them out of muscle magazines while she was watching the OJ Simpson trial in 1995,¡¨ the curator Jane Stubbs recalled. ¡§She got very involved in the trial and she took out her frustrations on thousands of men, thousands of penises.¡¨Berlin first met Warhol in 1964 at a party at the Factory, the artist¡¦s studio. Theirs was a friendship more intimate than the fame-hungry hangers-on that Warhol surrounded himself. ¡§Andy and I didn¡¦t go out that much together,¡¨ Berlin said. ¡§We¡¦d spend our time talking on the phone. He used to call me up in the morning.¡¨ Berlin and Warhol would accompany each other to the movies and the shops, but mostly they chatted, conversations which, with Warhol¡¦s consent, Berlin would record. She claimed she taped ¡§everything¡¨ in her life between 1967 and 1974, the oral documentation matched by thousands of Polaroids capturing Warhol¡¦s celebrity circle. Other images were self-portraits, the artist also experimenting with double exposure.¡§No picture ever mattered,¡¨ she said. ¡§There was never any subject that I was after. It was clicking it and pulling it out that I loved.¡¨ The actor Dennis Hopper in a cowboy hat, curly chest hair poking out the top of a white shirt, stares sadly at the camera in one picture. It is typically downbeat: despite her haphazard approach, Berlin¡¦s photographs tended towards melancholia. In a portrait of Nico, the singer¡¦s eyes are cast down; the journalist Diana Vreeland holds our gaze grimly; the artist Donald Judd seems suspicious. Few of Berlin¡¦s subjects ¡V the artists Gerhard Richter, grinning, and John Chamberlain, topless and tattooed ¡V seem to be enjoying the much mythologised New York scene.Brigid was born in Manhattan to Richard E Berlin, the chairman of the Hearst media empire, and his socialite wife, Honey (Muriel, nee Johnson). The couple hosted dinner parties at the apartment overlooking Central Park on Fifth Avenue at which Lyndon Johnson and J Edgar Hoover mixed with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford. Brigid recalled picking the phone up to find Richard Nixon on the line. She proved a disappointment to Honey, who considered her chubby, and aged 11 was put on a regime of weight-loss tablets. At 16 she was sent to a school in St Blaise, Switzerland, her European teachers instructed that their charge must ¡§lose 50 pounds¡¨. Instead she got drunk and high, and was kicked out.Brigid finished her education at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Eden Hall, in Pennsylvania, with holidays spent working at Harper¡¦s Bazaar, part of the Hearst empire. ¡§My mother wanted me to be a slim, respectable socialite ¡K Instead I became an overweight troublemaker,¡¨ Berlin gleefully recalled. In 1960, in yet another act of rebellion, Brigid wed a gay window dresser named John Parker. That marriage soon fell apart but not before Brigid enjoyed a wild summer with her father¡¦s Cadillac and credit card hanging out with Parker¡¦s gay friends on Fire Island.After a stint in rehab in Mexico (at a clinic recommended to her father by Lyndon Johnson), Brigid returned to New York and took a room at the Chelsea Hotel. The sojourn south had done nothing to quell her enthusiasm for amphetamines, and she soon earned the nickname ¡§Brigid Polk¡¨ for the injections ¡V the pokes ¡V of her favourite drug.Having appeared in his films Bike Boy, Imitation of Christ, Four Stars, The Nude Restaurant, Tub Girls (all 1967), The Loves of Ondine (1968), and Phoney (1973), in 1974 Brigid was appointed Warhol¡¦s studio manager.Interviewed in 1969, Warhol claimed Berlin made all his work, causing a fall in the artist¡¦s prices and desperate damage limitation from his gallery. It was not true, but Berlin certainly influenced him; swathes of his 1975 book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again, are from ideas she articulated; and her life story was the inspiration for Pork, his 1971 play about a society family and their rebellious daughter.Berlin had a show titled Polaroids and Tapes at Galerie Heiner Friedrich in Cologne in 1970 and in 1975 joined the staff on Warhol¡¦s Interview magazine, where she worked throughout the 80s, even after Warhol¡¦s death in 1987. ¡§I would transcribe interviews, and then for many years I didn¡¦t do anything. I used to knit and needlepoint under the desk. It wasn¡¦t like a job, so that¡¦s why I stayed there so long.¡¨By the beginning of the 90s she was clean from drugs, and in 1995 she showed Cock Book, a volume of penis doodles collected from the likes of Jasper Johns, Jane Fonda and Leonard Cohen, at the Gramercy International Art Fair. A collection of Tit Prints was exhibited in a show organised by Jane Stubbs on Madison Avenue a year later. A 2008 show at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller in New York also featured cushions, this time with needlepoint replicating salacious front pages from the New York Post.A 2015 show at Invisible Exports in the city showed her photographs, which were also the subject of Polaroids, a monograph published the same year. John Waters, who cast Berlin in two of his films, Serial Mom (1994) and Pecker (1998), wrote in the foreword in prayer form. ¡§Hail Brigid, full of attitude, Warhol is with thee. Blessed are thou among superstars and blessed is the fruit of blue blood privilege.¡¨She is survived by her brother Richard.',\n",
              " 'This new painting is based on a photo from Vice magazine of the grime star Tempa T, known for the genre¡¦s early anthem Next Hype. Yet the artist, Mike Silva, goes beyond that stage persona. With the background stripped out, the focus is on body language: a legs-wide pose whose casualness is undercut by questions around how society responds to black men asserting their presence.In Silva¡¦s paintings the politics of representation are both very present and pointedly understated. Portraits sit alongside luminous still-lifes and interiors where light breaks through windows on to half-empty shelves, record decks or the kitchen sink. These are rooms temporarily occupied by the short-life tenancy housing co-op the artist has long been a part of.Typically, the men Silva paints are those he has personally known: friends and lovers. These portraits start with a photo, snapped in the freshness of youth on his Pentax K1000 camera in the 90s and early-2000s. Occasionally, as with Tempa T, it¡¦s an image from an old style magazine such as Vice, those once unique storehouses of yesterday¡¦s music and fashion subcultures. The emphasis is on the fleeting and everyday, and its transformation through the labour-intensive business of changing the moment captured in a photographic image into the physical object that is a painting, which Silva creates by painting wet-on-wet.Using soft light, muted colours and quiet moments, the mood throughout all of Silva¡¦s work is both affirmative and gently mournful, for bygone times, places and the people we once were. Included in London Portraits, Interiors and Still Lives to 2 August ',\n",
              " 'In the latest instalment of the greatest genre of art news ¡V and I write that as a lover of art ¡V another restoration has gone awry. The word ¡§awry¡¨ is being generous.This is the revelation that a private collector, based in Valencia, paid 1,200 (1,070) for a restoration job on baroque painter Bartolom? Esteban Murillo¡¦s Immaculate Conception of Los Venerables. It is no longer immaculate. It now looks like an e-fit issued by a local police force, with those thin eyebrows popular in the 90s. What¡¦s more, the restorer (who it turns out was a furniture restorer by trade) made two attempts ¡V the second significantly worse than the first. That one, the e-fit one, has the Virgin Mary staring straight ahead, which isn¡¦t even the same position as the original, which has Mary looking to the heavens.Fernando Carrera, a professor at the Galician School for the Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage, referring to the latest artwork to be botched in Spain, told the Guardian: ¡§I don¡¦t think this guy ¡V or these people ¡V should be referred to as restorers. Let¡¦s be honest: they¡¦re bodgers who botch things up. They destroy things.¡¨If there is one saving grace, though I doubt the owner would agree, the painting was Murillo¡¦s copy of an earlier painting of his in oil, created sometime between 1660 and 1665.There¡¦s now a call for a change in the law to prevent non-trained restorers attempting such cleanup jobs. But Spain isn¡¦t the only nation to suffer similar accidents, despite being home to the greatest one of all time. Here are some of the best worst restorations in art.I mentioned the best one of all time, and it is impossible not to begin with it. In 2012, 81-year-old Cecilia Gim?nez, with the best of intentions, trashed a fresco painted in about 1930 by El?as Garc?a Mart?nez, entitled Ecce Homo (Behold the Man), in a church in Borja, Spain.The fresco became known as Behold the Monkey, and Monkey Christ, because of its newly simian features. Jesus¡¦s crown of thorns had also been transformed into what resembled a Russian ushanka hat, with an added vibe of Van Gogh¡¦s Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear. Plus an added border to look like a scroll, a little like an early Microsoft Word feature.Gim?nez maintains she had permission from the priest to get her brushes out, but that is disputed by others. She has always insisted that it was only because she went on holiday mid-job, and the painting wasn¡¦t finished, that it looks as it does. Brutally, her granddaughter threw her under the bus saying: ¡§She had just painted the tunic. The problem started when she painted on the head as well. She has destroyed this painting.¡¨The disfigurement is hilarious in its awfulness, but invasive press scrutiny took a toll on Gim?nez¡¦s health. Now, however, Gim?nez says when she looks at her work she sees only positives. It continues to bring others joy too; the botched Ecce Homo is now one of Borja¡¦s main tourist attractions, thought to have brought in close to 200,000 visitors. It has raised tens of thousands of euros for the church and also for charity, and spawned a documentary, Fresco Fiasco, as well as a multitude of merchandise. So much so that Gim?nez has called for a slice of the profits. Her own work also sells for higher sums than before.¡§They didn¡¦t let me finish,¡¨ Gim?nez later told Spanish daily El Pa?s. And we¡¦re all grateful for that, because it is perfect just as it is.In 2001, Damien Hirst, already famous for his formaldehyde works, opened a new exhibition at London¡¦s Eyestorm gallery, Painting-by-Numbers. This included an array of half-empty beer bottles and coffee cups, overflowing ashtrays and old newspapers arranged ¡V but looking strewn ¡V across the gallery.That is until cleaner Emmanuel Asare cleared it all away, thinking it was detritus from the launch party the night before. Asare said: ¡§As soon as I clapped eyes on it I sighed because there was so much mess. I didn¡¦t think for a second that it was a work of art ¡V it didn¡¦t look much like art to me. So I cleared it all into bin bags and dumped it.¡¨Gallery staff scoured through the rubbish and saved, well, the rubbish, and ¡§restored¡¨ the installation from photographs. Hirst, for his part, found the whole thing amusing, calling it ¡§fantastic¡¨ and ¡§very funny¡¨. Happily, Asare faced no repercussions.Then-editor of the art newspaper the Jackdaw, though, said that: ¡§If it doesn¡¦t look like a work of art, you can¡¦t blame people for getting rid of it. It is actually not difficult to replace it. Anything of seriously lasting value would be irreplaceable.¡¨But Hirst¡¦s work was estimated to have sold for a six-figure sum. Next up, possibly: someone tries to make Tracey Emin¡¦s My Bed.Spain again, where a 500-year-old wooden effigy of St George was, um, improved upon, in a church in the town of Estella. The result was something along the lines of a character who wouldn¡¦t look out of place in a Noddy cartoon. Who was also stoned.The restorer has never officially been identified, but the mayor of Estella said that the council of the region was not consulted beforehand and he was unimpressed, tweeting: ¡§Estella isn¡¦t in the news because of its spectacular historical, artistic, architectural or cultural heritage.¡¨ Accompanying the tweet was a picture from the local paper headlined: ¡§Navarra¡¦s own Ecce Homo¡¨.Eventually, the government¡¦s cultural department stepped in and the council paid 34,000 to have a professional restoration of the restoration job, using the traditional methods of x-rays and research from photographs. The original botchers were fined 6,000 for their efforts.I suppose setting out to sculpt a statue of someone as vain as the Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is always going to be a hiding to nothing, but Emanuel Santo¡¦s 2017 effort to garnish Madeira airport ¡V newly renamed after the star ¡V was ¡K quite something. That something was widely ridiculed (which, again, it would be nice if this could somehow be done in a kinder way than outright abuse). With its goofy, lopsided smile and loopy eyes, the bust looked nothing like Ronaldo, and even more so, looked entirely unhinged.Both Ronaldo himself and Portugal¡¦s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, were present at the grand and unintentionally hilarious unveiling. Ronaldo himself had apparently been happy with the bust, but had asked for some wrinkles to be removed around his (mad) eyes.Responding to the rest to the criticism, Santo said: ¡§It is impossible to please the Greeks and Trojans. Neither did Jesus please everyone.¡¨Still, Santo accepted a challenge from the football website Bleacher Report to give the much maligned bust a do-over a year later. But unfortunately by this time people had become fond of kooky Ronaldo and the update, while still looking nothing whatsoever like Ronaldo, was boring with zero personality and the consensus was that the first was better.¡§Look, they are both bad sculptures,¡¨ Eddy Frankel wrote in the Guardian. ¡§The first one is ludicrous, the second one is bland. But at least the first one is an honest representation of the artist¡¦s intentions.¡¨Three butcherings for the price of one! You probably don¡¦t need me to tell you the name of the country where these 2018 masterly transformations occurred of a trinity of late 15th-century statues. But I will say that the region was called Asturias, and the village itself Ra?adoiro.As you can see, the outcome of this particular ¡§freshening up¡¨ was the kind of makeup slathered on in a dark club mirror before emerging, blinking into the light, looking like the filling of a Victoria sponge.Frustratingly, the statues had been lovingly ¡V and importantly, professionally ¡V restored 15 years prior. Luis Su?rez Saro, who did that job, gave his opinion of the update: ¡§They¡¦ve used the kind of industrial enamel paint they sell for painting anything and absolutely garish and absurd colours. The result is just staggering. You don¡¦t know whether to laugh or cry.¡¨The dab hand or not so dab hand who elicited that reaction was Mar?a Luisa Men?ndez, a tobacco shop owner who was again good-intentioned and thought the statues looked dull.¡§I painted them as best I could using what I thought were the right colours. The neighbours liked them too. Ask around here and you¡¦ll find out.¡¨¡§I¡¦m not a professional painter,¡¨ she confirmed, unnecessarily.Not strictly works of art, but they certainly became them after their restorations. A doubly whammy of castles, just like the trips your mum dragged you on. The first, the 2,000-year-old Ocakli Ada castle, in ?ile near Istanbul, Turkey, became a social media sensation in 2015 when its restoration left it a dead ringer for the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. It¡¦s unclear whether this was the original intention, but one strongly suspects not. It was even criticised by the opposition party in the Turkish parliament.Back in, you guessed it, Spain, the Matrera Castle in Villamart?n was restored by architect Carlos Quevedo Rojas for hundreds of thousands of euros. The only problem was that the crumbling edifice ended up looking like an Ikea Billy bookcase. It was variously described as ¡§a barbarity¡¨ , ¡§truly lamentable¡¨ and ¡§a massacre of Spanish heritage¡¨. Which, as reviews go, aren¡¦t great. But hey, at least it elicited a (horrified) response.To end with, another laugh-out-loud effort. This time courtesy of Ontario, Canada. The head of a statue of baby Jesus which was apparently often lopped off and left ¡§rolling around on the ground¡¨ was stolen by vandals in 2015 (no, I¡¦m not sure why either). But local artist Heather Wise stepped in with a generous offer to restore the decapitated statue, which stood outside the Ste Anne des Pins Catholic church.Wise said she had never worked with stone before, but had studied sculpture at a local college. ¡§To do a statue of baby Jesus for a church is like an honour of my entire art career,¡¨ she said. Unfortunately, the results were ¡K surprising. An entirely random terracotta head, which many likened to Maggie Simpson, but also looked a bit like a gremlin, was added, and which soon started melting away in the rain.A kind commenter on a news site remarked: ¡§Since nobody knows what Jesus looked like, what difference does it make?¡¨ Others were not so keen. Brilliantly, after the new head was unveiled, the thief even returned the original head. By this time, however, the parish priest had grown fond of what has also been described as a ¡§demonic hedgehog¡¨. It was returned to Wise, though, who said she wanted it back because it had become her ¡§most famous piece of art¡¨. You can certainly see why.',\n",
              " 'A spectacular but rarely seen Canaletto painting of Westminster Abbey is to go on public display in the building it depicts for probably the first time in more than two centuries.Since 1792 it has hung in the the private living and entertaining quarters of the dean. It has been loaned a handful of times over the past 100 years to exhibitions but is thought never to have been on public display in the abbey itself.¡§It is one of the finest works of art which the abbey has,¡¨ said curator Susan Jenkins. ¡§We are very excited.¡¨The 1749 painting, Westminster Abbey with a procession of the Knights of the Bath, is the earliest work of art to depict the abbey¡¦s famous west towers, which were completed in 1745.The knights were a military order revived by George I in 1725 and its members were the great and good of Britain¡¦s armed forces. Every four years they have a ceremony if there is a new knight to be installed, and in the 18th century they would process from the abbey to to the Prince¡¦s Chamber in parliament.It is that arcane scene which Canaletto has painted. Jenkins said: ¡§It¡¦s beautifully painted and I always think the more you know about it, the more fascinating the painting it is.¡¨For example, in the doorway of the abbey is a table behind which the sovereign¡¦s master cook stands, wearing an apron and brandishing a chopping knife.His job, according to an account in the London Gazette, was to say to each of the knights processing past: ¡§Sir! You know what great oath you have taken, which if you keep it will be a great honour to you, but if you break it I shall be compelled, by my office, to hack off your spurs from your heel.¡¨The painting was commissioned by Joseph Wilcocks, the dean of Westminster, and was bequeathed to the Abbey by his son in 1792. Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of purpose-built gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display.Jenkins said there would have been drummers and trumpeters playing at the 1749 procession and the painting conveys that sense of spectacle and excitement.¡§I love the fact that the people watching the scenes in 1749 are very like now, the abbey has always been a place which drew crowds and put on wonderful spectacles. It still has that national focus.¡§It is beautifully painted and it is almost as if you are hovering above in a drone, your focus is on the top of the towers but you¡¦re aware of this great red procession going on. It lifts your spirits up.¡¨Canaletto remains one of the most celebrated painters of the 18th century. Mainly known for his pictures of Venice, he lived in England during 1746-55 and painted many London views, the majority of which were bought by George III and remain in the Royal Collection.',\n",
              " 'What¡¦s not to like about wood? It sucks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, then spits it out as lovely lengths of golden timber, ready to use for everything from eco-friendly buildings to biodegradable paper straws and cardboard cups. It is nature¡¦s wonder material, produced in an endlessly renewable, reusable and recyclable stream of green goodness. Right?Not so fast, say the designers behind the Serpentine Gallery¡¦s new exhibition, Cambio. The forestry industry is not quite as squeaky clean as the timber trade associations would have you believe, nor are paper and cardboard products necessarily the carbon-negative alternatives they claim to be. In the ethical maze of responsibly sourced materials, it seems we can¡¦t always see the cost of wood for the trees.Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin, the Italian duo behind Amsterdam-based design studio Formafantasma (meaning ¡§ghost form¡¨), have shone their aesthetically pleasing spotlight on the global dynamics of the timber industry to encourage us to see the material afresh. Marking the first chapter in the Serpentine¡¦s new foray into curating design in addition to its established programme of contemporary art, the exhibition attempts to draw the worlds of science, conservation, engineering and policymaking together in a research-driven show. The results are mixed, with some provocative ideas emerging from a display that has the overall feeling of browsing an Aesop concept store ¡V with wafts of artificial tree scent to match.One of the first things you encounter is a teetering totem pole of Ikea stools, the 20 Bekv?m, reliable provider of kitchen steps and houseplant stands to countless homes around the world. Formafantasma have remade the stool in seven different kinds of wood, from oak to chestnut and cherry, and stacked according to how long the tree grew before it was logged, and how much carbon dioxide it stored in the process.¡§The furniture industry¡¦s mass production model is based on the constant renewal of the source material and disposability of the item,¡¨ say the designers. ¡§But for wood products to be truly sustainable, they need to have a service life that is at least the same length of time that it took for the tree to grow.¡¨ Want the stool in walnut? You¡¦d better plan on keeping it for 120 years.Nearby, a pair of tables piled high with disposable paper and cardboard products tells a similar story. There¡¦s a smallish pile of reinforced envelopes, a fair stack of paper towels and a couple of towers of takeaway containers and paper cups. The work is titled 5 Years, the amount of time it will take a single pine tree to reabsorb the same amount of carbon dioxide released when each pile is discarded. The sight of just a few cardboard boxes equating to five years¡¦ worth of arboreal labour might make you feel a bit queasy about all that Amazon packaging you dutifully put out with the recycling every week.On an adjacent wall, a number of wooden objects are lined up in a row, a hammer next to a ping-pong bat, a guitar next to a brush, like evidence gathered from a crime scene. The sense of a police lineup is apt: a clipboard of material analysis beneath each item reveals the amount of endangered timber featured in these everyday objects. A dark, polished violin chin-rest is made of Brazilian rosewood, a timber for which ¡§the risk of illegal logging is high¡¨. The brush handles and drumsticks, meanwhile, are made from ramin, an endangered south-east Asian hardwood, while a spatula handle has been whittled from threatened African bubinga. According to Interpol, which seizes thousands of these items every year, illegally sourced wood products account for 15-30% of all global timber trade.Despite the number of international conventions in place to curb illegal logging (dutifully printed out and drily displayed on tables), it seems we haven¡¦t come too far from the 19th-century thirst for exotic tropical hardwoods, shown in all its colonial ostentation at the back of the gallery. Trimarchi and Farresin have raided the archives at Kew Gardens and collected a handsome haul of timber specimens, which were originally shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, just across the park. Marvel at the great polished slice of a mahogany tree trunk brought back from British Honduras, or the jet-black obelisk of Ceylon ebony, advertised as being ¡§used in turnery for fancy articles¡¨.',\n",
              " 'There¡¦s a corny joke going around this year¡¦s Armory show that instead of shaking hands ¡V to stay coronavirus-free ¡V there¡¦s the Armory arm bump, like bumping fists, but with elbows. Arm-ory, get it?But the virus leading to the cancellation of several cultural events across the world, the much-anticipated annual New York art fair has proceeded as usual (with only the odd mask-wearing fair-goer). About eight art fairs within the show are opening this week, featuring hundreds of artists and galleries across Manhattan. This year, the most pronounced theme is environmental art.Baltimore artist Cynthia Daignault is showing a new set of paintings at the Night Gallery Booth at the Armory entitled Delia¡¦s Gone, a series focused on powerful women in the public eye ¡V from Malala Yousafzai to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Greta Thunberg. ¡§It¡¦s hard with the current media climate to not be thinking about the role of women in power,¡¨ said Daignault. ¡§There¡¦s a real price that¡¦s paid with that power, they face intense backlash.¡¨Her portrait of Thunberg ties into her tradition of environmental-focused art, specifically, how natural beauty is met with destruction. ¡§There¡¦s a fear that¡¦s grounded in real facts and changes we¡¦re seeing; fires, floods, natural disasters but also the warming climate, the rising sea levels,¡¨ she said. ¡§There¡¦s a corresponding anxiety that goes along with that.¡¨In a seductive, sleek digital video on view at the bitforms gallery booth at the Spring/Break art show, New York artist Jonathan Monaghan looks at the digital age¡¦s connection to excess. ¡§It¡¦s about the end of the world, where there¡¦s a lot of concern, ecologically speaking, about sustainability and the future of our current system, which is on shaky ground,¡¨ said the artist, whose video Out of the Abyss suggests the effects of consumer consumption. With online shopping growing at an exponential rate, free shipping services have a huge carbon footprint with freight vehicles in constant transit (the electric vans Amazon promised won¡¦t hit the road before 2024).¡§I¡¦m interpreting the apocalypse for the digital age, it¡¦s about the environment and ecology, but also surveillance and mass media,¡¨ Monaghan said. ¡§In the video, we¡¦re looking at the recreation of an Amazon Go store, where there¡¦s no checkout, you take things off the shelves and Amazon knows what you bought and who you are. With our obsession with buying things and surveillance, it¡¦s connected; there¡¦s a discord between the natural elements and the synthetic elements.¡¨Iranian American artist Sheida Soleimani will also be continuing to focus on Iran¡¦s political climate for her symbol-heavy artwork. Here, she sheds a light on crude oil consumption at the Edel Assanti booth at the Armory, by the way of crude petroleum byproducts. ¡§Basically, everything in the word is made from crude petroleum oil, it¡¦s also an environmental hazard,¡¨ said Soleimani, rolling her eyes, whose works in the purple-painted booth look to the recent protests in Iran, the oil and uranium enrichment, Iran¡¦s internet blackout and blame0shifting between Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani, who point their fingers at each other here.In one piece, she has photographed consumer products that use ¡¥Iran Heavy¡¦ crude oil, which is produced on Kharg Island; she shows a disfigured portrait of a fish chewing bubblegum, as bubblegum is made of crude oil, stylized as a luscious product photo. It¡¦s shown alongside gym weights, which are also filled with the oil. The crude oil is not only destroying the environment, but the agricultural sector in Iran. ¡§Fish you¡¦d find in the area, which is being destroyed by oil pollution in the water, are dying,¡¨ said Soleimani. ¡§It¡¦s about the give and take. What do we get from it and what dies from it?¡¨New York-based artist Scooter LaForge has built a booth at Spring/Break made entirely from recycled materials. ¡§Everything here is upcycled or recycled,¡¨ he said, pointing around. ¡§The plates are secondhand from a Chinese restaurant, all the walls are covered in donated fabric, or stuff from Salvation Army, this wood I found on street for my canvases,¡¨ he said. The booth, Please Don¡¦t Feed the Animals, looks at what he calls a ¡§beastly banquet¡¨ that links animal farming with the climate crisis.¡§It has to do with agriculture and farming animals, its connection to global warming and the fires in Australia and Brazil,¡¨ said LaForge. ¡§The plates represent slaughtered animals and the bowls represent a happier animal, how farming and agriculture is a direct effect to fires and wildfires.¡¨With the recent news of tropical forests losing their ability to absorb carbon, which will see lasting effects over the next decade, the Brazil fires hit a deep spot for the artist. ¡§In Brazil, they burned the indigenous rainforest to create farms for animals, and the dryness in Australia is a direct result of global warming and emissions from animals in agriculture,¡¨ he said.The artist¡¦s work is loosely based on trailblazing feminist artist Judy Chicago¡¦s famed 1979 piece The Dinner Party, which offers a table place for overlooked women in history. Here, the table places are for animals.Upon walking into Washington-based artist Rachel Schmidt¡¦s booth at Spring/Break, one can¡¦t help but think of garbage ¡V junk is strewn across the floor. ¡§That¡¦s my microwave that broke,¡¨ she says, pointing to a box in the corner, alongside single-use plastic waste. This project, Vanishing Points, puts consumer products on view, some of which will take 450 years to fully biodegrade (the artist links the time span from the Baroque era). Curated by Dawne Langford, the artwork includes recycled tissue paper, paint cans, bottles and foam packaging. ¡§I focused on plastics that will not be recycled,¡¨ said Schmidt. ¡§The majority of the plastics here are all type five and six plastics that will never get reused or processed. Really, the only way to not have them here is to stop consuming, but how close are we ever going to get to that?¡¨The artist¡¦s videos here are inspired by how climate change has impacted different parts of the world. ¡§Everyone is handling it a bit differently, there¡¦s clips I shot in Taipei, where they recycle everything,¡¨ she said. The artist, too, is mindful of how she recycles. Schmidt has committed to a more sustainable, eco-friendly practice by repurposing other materials. ¡§There¡¦s a ton of exciting stuff going on in Taiwan because they¡¦re an island,¡¨ she said. ¡§They¡¦re going to feel the impact of climate change in a more abrupt fashion than most of us will.¡¨',\n",
              " 'It was with no small degree of scepticism that I recently journeyed to the lodgings of a Viktor Wynd Esquire in the East End of London. It had been relayed to my editor, on what I deemed to be dubious authority, that Wynd was the keeper of rare and exotic beasts, and that his basement dwellings contained examples not just of two-headed lambs and mummified fairies but also of erotica so unseemly it could redden the eyes of anyone who glanced upon it. It had furthermore been rumoured, in less salubrious quarters, that Wynd was a purveyor of hallucinatory liquors in his upstairs bar ¡V and would dispense them to paying punters alongside small packets of miniature anuses sculpted from Belgian chocolate.This Wynd character, it seemed likely to me, would prove to be nothing more than a charlatan ¡V if indeed he existed at all. But after relaying such doubts to my editor, I was displeased to find him still keen on ushering me out the door on a blustery March morning to investigate further.I perchanced upon The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & UnNatural History before the clock struck 11, with instructions to knock twice and attend its opening. Wynd was in, as fortune would have it, and I must report he is indeed a most curious gentleman. He greeted me in a suit of pink velvet and was possessed of both a fine beard and a mischievous glint in his eye. After making pleasantries, I requested a visit to the water closet, which I confess to having found rather disturbing on account of a bronze sculpture of Wynd¡¦s bottom on the outer door ¡V for no other purpose than to fondle, it seemed to me ¡V and a photograph purporting to depict his own suicide, positioned next to the cistern.Feeling somewhat unsettled by this, I then descended with Wynd to his basement, whereby I was forced to admit that his home was, indeed, most unlike any other I have come across. A half-monkey half-fish hung in wait atop the stairs, suspended from the ceiling, its mouth preserved in some kind of blood-curdling scream. At the bottom of the staircase lay the legbone of, Wynd attested, a giant. ¡§Our rational friends would have us believe it¡¦s from a mammoth,¡¨ he murmured, ¡§but a giant is more fun.¡¨No sooner had we arrived in this darkened lair than Wynd disappeared upstairs to concoct me a warming beverage of what he said would be liquorice root, while I was permitted to peruse his collection at my leisure. It was a most peculiar assortment: feathers from extinct birds, shrunken human heads, the golden-plated skull of one of drug lord Pablo Escobar¡¦s hippopotamuses, artworks by the great English surrealists, a lock of Elvis Presley¡¦s hair, a syringe found in the very room where artist Sebastian Horsley died, the skull of a cyclops, portraits of fellating nuns, radioactive seashells, condoms made specifically for the less well-endowed, and jars containing the ¡§preserved front bottoms of Victorian prostitutes¡¨, or so the labels read.¡§And this,¡¨ spoke a voice from within the gloom, ¡§is a horse¡¦s stomach that¡¦s been infected with botflies!¡¨ This startled me somewhat, because I had not noticed Wynd¡¦s return. ¡§They lay their eggs around the horse¡¦s mouth and then, when it licks them, the eggs go in, the larva hatches, attaches itself to the horse¡¦s stomach and pupates.¡¨ He paused and intoned: ¡§You can¡¦t make this stuff up.¡¨I studied Wynd¡¦s expression closely in the murky light. For surely a man of twisted means could make this stuff up, and indeed would ¡V were it to prove successful in providing even modest financial remuneration. I glanced up and noticed a jar resting on a shelf, with its label claiming it contained the faecal matter of a Ms A Winehouse. The specimen, Wynd claimed, aroused the attention of the Human Tissue Authority, who recently paid a visit. This suggestion struck me as preposterous, and my suspicions around Wynd redoubled.We retired to a bench at Wynd¡¦s sarcophagus, the top of which boasted a glass panel through which to view the human remains within. Next to Wynd sat a taxidermied goat ¡V a self-portrait, he said, while stroking its face. I sipped my drink and listened to his divulgences, the details of which I reproduce faithfully for you now.Wynd told me how he¡¦d started collecting as a boy, but that upon reaching manhood, when his peers found their interests diverted elsewhere, he had simply kept going. ¡§I grew orchids and carnivorous plants, I kept reptiles. And I still do those things.¡¨His curiosities are the spoil of Wynd¡¦s countless voyages around the globe ¡V to the Congo or along the Sepik river in Papua New Guinea, where Wynd was enthused to find they still discuss spirits and fairies. ¡§Not a conversation you can have seriously here, even though right up until 70 years ago it would not have been regarded as unusual.¡¨ Wynd also told me about his own travel agency, Gone With the Wynd, which he set up so that others could accompany him. But he was adamant that travel was not essential for building a collection: ¡§I could find an amazing broken children¡¦s toy just by looking in the gutter.¡¨How did he know how much to offer for such unusual items? ¡§It¡¦s what I¡¦ve got in my bank account that day,¡¨ he ventured. ¡§If I can afford it and I want it, then I tend to buy it.¡¨ He furrowed his brow. ¡§I was just the other day offered a mummified arm, but I hadn¡¦t 2,000 on me.¡¨ Could he not have haggled? ¡§I¡¦m not interested in haggling. And it¡¦s not the end of the world if I can¡¦t get one specific thing. I see the museum more as a three-dimensional fictional novel ¡V a sculpture of the inside of my brain.¡¨Before opening his museum, Wynd told me he had been a disillusioned artist: ¡§I got bored. The great triumph was if some boring rich person came in and bought something. I gained no pleasure from that.¡¨Instead he turned his attention to throwing debauched parties throughout the 00s: ¡§My life at that time was as hedonistic as I could make it and still be alive to tell the story,¡¨ he sighed. Wynd recalled for me the occasion he transformed one venue into a recreation of the Onion Cellar from G?nter Grass¡¦s The Tin Drum ¡V filling it with dead flowers while fining anybody caught smiling the sum of one pound. ¡§I made chopping boards in the shape of teardrops so guests could chop onions and cry. I suppose it was a commentary on the reason why people drink and take drugs until 6am. A lot of it is to do with escaping the black dog you live with.¡¨After 10 years, Wynd¡¦s parties started to blur into one. So he turned his attentions to his childhood passion: collecting. At first the building was known as Viktor Wynd¡¦s Little Shop of Horrors, the business side of his endeavour leaving him at near-permanent risk of financial collapse. Now it exists as a museum (6 entrance) and absinthe bar, which allows Wynd the freedom to turn himself to other projects. One of these is a new book, The UnNatural History Museum, a tome that has been written with admirable wit and whimsy. In it, Wynd delightfully recounts the stories around the items he has amassed: a wooden carving believed to tell the story of a New Guinean village in which the women spurned the men as lovers for dogs; a tongue-eating louse (¡§the most disgusting thing in my collection¡¨); even a curious crinkled stone that turns out to be a baked potato Wynd once left in his Aga (¡§I found it rather attractive so I kept it¡¨).Indeed, it was while lost in these pages that my perception of Wynd began to change. I had assumed him to be a shallow fellow, but the book reveals instead a tortured soul, drawn to solitude and prone to melancholy. Indeed, I am still haunted by something Wynd opined: ¡§Being alive is a terribly sad and miserable experience. There are little chinks of happiness and joy that light up an otherwise dark world. But we are all miserable, aren¡¦t we?¡¨The degree of Wynd¡¦s sadness is difficult to discern. The museum is still open at the time of going to press, and he is about to stage a deconstructed version of his collection in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth, where visitors will be able to see such wonders as a ¡§swoose¡¨ (¡§A cross between a swan and a goose, one of five, preserved by the esteemed Victorian taxidermist TE Gunn¡¨) and a caul, the amniotic sack that lies stretched over the face of one in every 80,000 children after birth. ¡§If you were born like that,¡¨ he whispered conspiratorially, ¡§you were supposed to have magical powers. This one was found in a family Bible!¡¨It was while discussing such oddities that Wynd seemed at his most animated. ¡§You must come to Falmouth!¡¨ he declared. ¡§But I won¡¦t be there. I¡¦m going to be in west Africa for voodoo ceremonies.¡¨He was insistent we see yet more of his objects, including an orchidometer used for the measurement of testicles and a human intestinal worm. Was this tiny basement, I asked myself, where the world¡¦s true magic and wonder resided? But just as I was beginning to fall under my host¡¦s charming spell, my attention was seized by an item of such alarming grotesquery that I tremble even now to recount it in full. For lying beneath a glass display cabinet of bones, toy dolls and sordid literature was a full length, semi-rotting human figure. I leaned towards it cautiously, only to jump back with fright. The left half was unmistakably that of the bass baritone and political activist Mr Paul Robeson. But the right side ¡K well that was ¡K no ¡K surely not ¡K a topless and fishnetted Ms Pamela Anderson.¡§Ah yes, the Pamela Anderson and Paul Robeson Unification Cake,¡¨ explained Wynd, although whether you consider that an explanation, dear reader, I will leave to you. Wynd then recalled how it was created by the artist Magnus Irvin, the same entity who concocted the chocolate anuses sold upstairs. ¡§He also made our wedding cake,¡¨ added Wynd, whose domestic contentment ¡V he has taken a good lady wife, with whom he has three young girls ¡V doesn¡¦t entirely chime with the forlorn figure depicted in his book. ¡§At the ceremony everyone was dressed as animals. Although we weren¡¦t. We didn¡¦t want to look silly.¡¨Wynd laughed and, trapped in the darkness, I felt suddenly gripped by a stomach-churning sensation. Whether it was the liquorice brew I¡¦d imbibed or something more sinister, I could not say. But I knew I must leave while I still could.I made my excuses and turned towards the staircase, only to hear Wynd call after me, distraught. I glanced over my shoulder and saw him gesturing towards a stuffed monkey.¡§But you haven¡¦t met Hamlet!¡¨ he cried, as I made a bid for the daylight, finally realising that the strangest beast in all this museum was not the two-headed lamb nor the wretched screaming mer-monkey ¡K but Wynd himself.',\n",
              " 'Mark Wallinger hopes bored people everywhere will draw their own hand and put it in their window as a kind of nationwide wave and Jeremy Deller suggests we write songs about toilet roll.Michael Landy, an artist best known for destroying all his possessions, will tread more alarming ground. He will suggest children find something in the house they can take apart and get an adult to put it back together again.¡§It could be fantastic,¡¨ said Sally Shaw, the gallery boss asking visual artists to come up with creative activities for the lockdown. ¡§Or, yes, it could be a real pain. I can imagine the things I don¡¦t want taken apart in my house.¡¨Shaw is the director of Firstsite gallery in Colchester, which this week will launch a downloadable artist activity pack to entertain and engage children and young people during the lockdown.The idea came from Shaw¡¦s own memories of school holidays. ¡§When I was a kid, my mum gave me this massive book called The Big Book of Things to Do. She would give me that on day one of the summer holidays and was like ¡K ¡¥See you later!¡¦¡§I loved it because on every page there was something to do and you could do it with stuff you had around the house.¡§I was reminded of that as all this stuff was kicking off so I thought, let¡¦s do it. We know lots of artists, let¡¦s make the ultimate artists¡¦ activity pack with all the best people you could possibly think of in it.¡¨It is a simple but tricky brief to artists : the activity has got to be fun; it can be explained or done on an A4 sheet of paper; it can be done by a children or adult or both together; and ideally it is something which can be shared.Wallinger wants people to trace their hand and then draw in all the details. He said he was inspired by prehistoric cave painters who used their hands as stencils.He wants people to put the drawing in a window and also post it online. ¡§The idea is that it becomes a gesture of contact ¡K to wave at someone is a thing we all learned to do very early on.¡¨Around 10 artists including Gillian Wearing and Idris Khan are contributing to the first set of activities, with Shaw hoping to put out new ideas from other artists on a weekly basis.Others include Antony Gormley who has come up with a ¡§people¡¦s paper chain¡¨ idea. The piece of paper will have a drawing of a person on it which can be folded and cut into a paper chain.Deller has put together a list of 10 things that ¡§might be art¡¨, some of which he has done before ¡V notably, put on an exhibition in your bedroom.There is also: make a monument to key workers and write a song about toilet roll. ¡§What he really wants is some kind of national competition, one for kids, one for adults, with people writing songs about toilet rolls,¡¨ said Shaw.Other artists include Annie Morris, who will, in the coming weeks, contribute line drawings that can be coloured in; and Ryan Gander, who has made a set of labels you can put on things around the house, so ¡§find something which is metallic¡¨ or ¡§find something which is moveable¡¨.¡§There are loads of really sweet, lovely, charming ideas coming through,¡¨ said Shaw. ¡§They are good fun and can be done together.¡¨More artists, including Grayson Perry, are getting on board and the idea is that the pack, titled ¡§Art is where the home is¡¨ grows week by week.The project is aimed at children and young people, but adults are in no way excluded, said Shaw.¡§From what we¡¦ve got so far, these are all things which anyone can do and it would be nice if all sorts of people felt they wanted to get involved. It¡¦s about creativity and using your imagination ¡V?and we all can do that.¡¨',\n",
              " 'It¡¦s a good principle that, except in exceptional circumstances, architecture critics see the buildings that they review. You wouldn¡¦t want a food critic to recommend a restaurant based on photographs of loaded plates, nor a theatre critic to base their judgments on films of performances. You¡¦re meant to sniff, feel and sense the things you describe, to experience them in the round.There¡¦s a downside to this good principle, which is that buildings don¡¦t come to you, and that many fine works are done all over the world which it would be absurdly expensive and eco-reckless to visit. Circumstances are, what¡¦s more, what can only be described as exceptional. Given that almost everywhere is now almost equally inaccessible, whether another county or another continent, I¡¦ve decided to make an opportunity out of a problem, and to offer a world tour of the very best new architecture, as seen through the portal of a laptop.It helps that there are several websites ¡V Dezeen, ArchDaily, Designboom, Archinect, or the pickier Domusweb, Archpaper, the Architectural Review and Wallpaper* ¡V that daily display new architectural gems sent to them by hopeful practices. I therefore propose a top 10 of the hundreds that have been published on these sites in the time of Covid-19. The start of this period is tricky to define, but let¡¦s say it was early March, which was when it dawned that this is a truly worldwide crisis.It¡¦s a varied harvest. There are attention-seekers and duds among those hundreds of projects. There are a few ambulance-chasers ¡V those who seek to promote themselves by proposing their very own architectural responses to emergencies, responses for which nobody asked. But there is also the never-ending desire of architects to discover in every building project the chance to make the world a little more interesting and a little more enjoyable. The best of these projects are theatres for life, whether that life is seeing art, living in your home, going to school or meeting friends, and wherever it might take place: in an ancient city, in a refugee camp, in deep countryside. They aim to make that life richer, fuller and more surprising.A few things stand out. One is the quality of work in places not traditionally seen as architectural powerhouses, such as Vietnam, Lebanon, Bangladesh and Paraguay. There is a related lack of really big names, the Dutch MVRDV being the best known to make the list. There¡¦s no single dominating style, although it is somewhat amazing how prevalent is a version of modernism that first matured some time in the middle of the last century ¡V one that favours undecorated but textured surfaces like timber and rough concrete, sculpted into plain but sometimes complex forms.There¡¦s a good side to the persistence of this style ¡V if it ain¡¦t broke why fix it? ¡V but it leaves you wondering why this century doesn¡¦t have more to add. You are also grateful for those works that offer something else entirely: the self-indulgent but entertaining guesthouse Alex, for example, or the bamboo-built safe space. In some of the choices there¡¦s a certain attraction to the creative reuse of wrecked old buildings. This ruinlust might betray a personal preference, but it also reveals some architects¡¦ move away from the making of brand new magic objects towards the mining of the already-there.There are hazards in this operation. It¡¦s hard to tell at a distance if a building presents an ugly backside to its neighbours, or if there are catastrophic details out of sight of the camera. Did the budgets spiral out of control? Did any of these marvels reduce their clients or builders to sobbing wrecks? Are those humanitarian projects actually diverting resources from more essential but less photogenic purposes? I¡¦ll guess not, but it¡¦s difficult to know for sure.Mostly, it¡¦s heartening. There¡¦s energy and invention out there, plus the ability to respond to unusual and challenging situations. Which are qualities we will all need, whenever we are allowed out in public again.Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear, C?ceres, Spain, by Emilio Tu??nOn the one hand there¡¦s the stately rhythm of white pillars, which speak of temple-like repose. On the other there¡¦s an intricate series of steps and terraces, both inside and out, that work their way up, around and through the building, such that it grows out of the hilly city around it. Stillness meets movement, in other words. Closer examination reveals other nuances: the concrete verticals narrow as they get higher, and what at first sight seem rectangular rooms are skewed into parallelograms. A dignified and subtle work.Tainan Spring, Taiwan, by MVRDVMost towns and cities have one: a senescent shopping centre once hailed as an economic engine, now overstaying its welcome like a kitchen appliance that the binmen won¡¦t take away. Tainan Spring offers a bold and direct response. Here the ruins of the China-Town mall, built over an old harbour in 1983, have been made into a public ¡§lagoon¡¨, whose levels change with dry and rainy seasons, and with cooling vapour mists when it¡¦s hot. It¡¦s promised that the vegetation will become lush in three years, in evocation of the jungle that was there before the city came.Beyond Survival Safe Space, Teknaf, Bangladesh, by Rizvi HassanThis is a sheltered place in a camp for 600,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, where young women and girls can gather. It is built and decorated by residents of the camp, using locally sourced bamboo. As it was built in a hurry its materials will be short-lived, to be replaced by more durable alternatives later. While addressing these urgent practicalities, the structure achieves a ragged grace, with its oval form and undulating roof. Seen from a distance it looks like a union of a vital purpose and thoughtful design. Which, very possibly, it is.Mac House, Novelda, Spain, by La Errer?aThis is a work of houses-within-a-house-within-a-house. Each bedroom is in a little wooden pitched-roofed cabin, placed at different levels within a simple pitched-roofed shell, which is set within the remnants of an older building. Space flows through the ensemble, with a handsome open staircase wandering up from the ground floor living space. It¡¦s a nice meditation on shelter, on inside and outside, and on the passage of time. It makes a spatial adventure out of living in a house.Alex¡¦s guesthouse, Berlare, Belgium, by Atelier Vens VanbelleThis Belgian folly, built for a client in the film industry, has the three-dimensional joy that tends to get squeezed out of larger projects. The timber interior seems hewn and cave-like. The rust-coloured exterior, with a little periscopic tower, looks like a beached submarine. A basement mini-cinema, in homage to Twin Peaks, has a red curtain. It runs several gamuts ¡V from earth to sky, from homely to weird, from natural to artificial ¡V which is a lot for a little building.Stone Garden, Beirut, by Dorell Ghotmeh Tane Architects/ Lina Ghotmeh ¡V ArchitectureTrees in the sky are currently a bit of a thing, and this Beirut apartment block is not the only example to have hit the internet lately. What makes the Stone Garden interesting is its sharp angles, derived from its tight urban site, plus its earthy, striated external finish, plus its cliff-like form, plus the sense its deep-set windows give that this is a building inhabited by actual people, not just glass-sheathed real estate. So it is mineral-urban-geometric all at once, with the vegetation, like city-sized parsley or coriander, providing a nice garnish.B? Mon preschool, T? Nang, Vietnam, by Kientruc OIt¡¦s a simple enough idea: a big distinctive roof that casts a big distinctive shadow that moves around during the course of the day. So the shadow becomes an animated thing in its own right, not just the absence of sun. The curvy shapes might be said to have some harmony with the surrounding hills. A tree is hugged at the entrance. The corrugated metal construction is basic, with some sensible-looking devices to ensure ventilation. Charming and deft and does what it says on the tin.Emergency Scenery, Olot, Spain, by unparelld¡¦arquitectesOn a raw spot left by the demolition of a house, a triple arch of skinny grandeur is created, like a secular version of a church portico. It combines solid and thin materials, and reused and new. There¡¦s not much you can do with it, apart from sit or perform on its stone steps. It depends on its power of proposition: it suggests that the little square that it faces is a place where something or other of interest ¡V quite what remains to be discovered ¡V might happen.UHP synagogue, Asunci?n, Paraguay, by Equipo de ArquitecturaLike many projects that adorn the architectural internet, this synagogue uses the motifs and strategies developed by mid-century modernists 70 years ago. But the architects wield these familiar tools with skill and sense, using concrete, rusty metal and reddish timber to effect the transition from robust exterior to reflective interior. Light is filtered through screens or descends from above. The ceremonial space envelops the congregation with wooden walls and ceiling that are also poised and geometrical. It gives the impression, at least from 6,000 miles away, of a warm if formal hug.Fass school and teachers¡¦ residence, Fass, Senegal, by Toshiko MoriIt¡¦s doughnut-shaped and made of local natural materials, and so might be compared to the Rohingya safe space, but there the likenesses end. The Fass school, designed for the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation by the New York-based Toshiko Mori, is less urgent and more artful. Its geometry has some twists: the roof varies in dimension and elevation, for example, around its elliptical orbit. This makes for some delightful-looking or at least intriguing spaces, where the white walls and thatched ceilings achieve a wide and surprising range of heights and shapes.',\n",
              " 'She is regarded as one of Scotland¡¦s most significant and original artists, whose achievement of international recognition was unkindly stalled by her death from breast cancer at the age of 42.Now Joan Eardley¡¦s family, friends and multitude admirers are calling for a major exhibition as her centenary year approaches, to bring her startling, engulfing work to a wider audience.¡§This is a difficult moment for our leading public galleries, with exhibitions being postponed or cancelled,¡¨ says Frances Spalding, an art historian. ¡§If one of these institutions wants to pick up on a centenary in the autumn of 2021, then give us a powerful show on Joan Eardley.¡§Long overdue is the opportunity to share in her immersive experience of ¡¥just vast waste and vast seas and vast areas of cliff¡¦ at Catterline, a small fishing village on the Kincardineshire coast; or ¡¥this richness which Glasgow has¡¦ that she found in Townhead. She died in 1963, but her work remains irresistibly vital.¡¨Eardley was born in 1921 and moved with her family from London to Glasgow as a teenager. She enrolled at the city¡¦s school of art, where her developing style was heavily influenced by the Scottish Colourists.After travelling in Europe on a scholarship, she returned to Glasgow where she set up a studio in Townhead, a city centre sprawl of overcrowded tenements. Working in chalks and oil, she could be seen transporting her easel around in an old pram, and local children met her with fascination, no doubt appreciating the few pennies she offered them to sit for her. Drawn to the ramshackle kinship of the place, she grew friendly with a number of local families, in particular the 12 Samson siblings, who became her regular subjects.While Eardley¡¦s portrayals of poverty have invited comparisons with Van Gogh, Muriel Gray, the chair of Glasgow School of Art, recalls being frightened of a painting of the Samson girls when she was a child, then riveted by her work as a student.Gray, who likewise declared herself ¡§baffled¡¨ at the lack of fulsome centenary celebration, explains: ¡§Those paintings were so disquieting. People talk about her humanity in painting children in rags, but perhaps she saw something even deeper, about what poverty does to children.¡¨Eardley made an abrupt switch from portraiture to landscapes after spending time on the north-east coast while convalescing from mumps. On hearing that a storm was approaching, she would catch the next train from Glasgow to Stonehaven, and make the rest of the journey to Catterline on her Lambretta.There she created her elemental panoramas of land and sea in thickly textured paint, working outdoors and securing the huge boards she used with ropes and boulders. Eardley died three months after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1963. She had been too ill to attend her first solo exhibition in London that year. Her ashes were scattered on Catterline beach.She was ¡§a landscape painter of stirring genius¡¨, says Laura Cumming, an author and art critic for the Observer, who describes her as ¡§one of the most original and independent artists who ever lived¡¨.¡§I grew up loving her work in my native Edinburgh, where her paintings were on view in the public museums. So it is both a shock and a scandal to me that in all these years she has had no such recognition outside Scotland. This is the equivalent of ignoring a K?the Kollwitz, a Gwen John or a Louise Bourgeois. London needs to wake up to Eardley and I offer to curate a touring show at the drop of a hat, so a new generation can be seized by her magnificence.¡¨The Guardian understands that approaches are being made to the Tate and the Royal Academy. While the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done much to cement her reputation with two major shows in 2007 and 2017, Glasgow has yet to offer Eardley similar recognition. While both cities are said to be considering smaller events for 2021, enthusiasts believe that no major institution seizing the opportunity presented by her centenary year reveals a mystifying lack of vision.Anne Morrison, Eardley¡¦s niece, a ceramicist based near Glasgow, says she is always surprised ¡§how many people know her work and say they don¡¦t get to see enough of it. A hundred years seems the right time to have a big show.¡¨',\n",
              " 'My friend Patrick Burke, who has died aged 92, was a crusading and inspirational designer, teacher, novelist and sculptor who was head of graphic design at Ravensbourne College of Art in London for 12 years.He was born in Ealing, west London, the elder son of Patrick Burke, an engineer¡¦s toolmaker, and his wife, Leonora (nee Maud-Humfrey). Leaving Hayes county grammar school aged 17, he enrolled at Camberwell School of Art, specialising in graphic design and typography.After graduating in 1951 he served an apprenticeship with HMV and then worked for a series of companies designing promotions and consumer goods. By 1958, with a reputation for striking graphics and exhibitions, he became head of industrial design for J Lyons and Co, creating furniture and interiors. He also designed the auditorium and sets for the May Fair theatre in London. In 1963 he launched his own freelance practice.In 1967 Patrick began teaching part-time at Hornsey College of Art in north London as leader of its industrial design course, giving it a seismic redirection. In 1969 he became head of graphic design at Ravensbourne College of Art (now Ravensbourne University London), where he introduced radical improvements to the course.To free students from conventional layout grids and give them insight into their own thinking, he introduced communication theory, semiology, kinesics, language systems and creative problem-solving strategies ¡V including game playing and cryptic crosswords. The emphasis was always on divergent thinking. In 1971 he was appointed editor of Icographic, the quarterly magazine of the International Council of Graphic Design Association, creating its design, writing, content and form for 15 issues up to 1979. Then after leaving Ravensbourne he taught courses in Israel, Canada and Ireland before retiring from teaching in 1995. In 1980 he married Alison (nee Dunsmore). When in 1990 they moved to Ramsgate, Kent,he wrote a novel, Gullscliff, about a colourful sculptor, published in 1998. It prompted him to try sculpture himself, and thereafter he devoted his time both to writing and sculpture. His 2018 exhibition of drawings and carvings at the Pie Factory Gallery, Margate, was sensational.I became friends with Patrick and Alison in Ramsgate. We often met at the Vinyl Head coffee house (now Eats ¡¦n¡¦ Beats), where people came to talk, rail at the Tories, discuss Ramsgate and art, and the latest devious clues in the day¡¦s Guardian cryptic crossword. We both took part in the monthly poets¡¦ performances in the cafe. He was warm, interesting, clever and funny.Patrick is survived by Alison, by his daughter, Kirsten, from his earlier marriage to Marijke Singer, which ended in divorce, and by his stepchildren, Victoria and James.',\n",
              " 'In 1984, a group of women in New York gathered outside the Museum of Modern Art as part of a protest. A group show, An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture, was showing 165 artists, 152 male artists exhibited alongside just 13 women.Outraged, they attended the protest, bringing placards and chanting outside the museum. But a handful of women within the larger crowd learned something.¡§We realized it didn¡¦t work, nobody cared about what we were saying,¡¨ artist K?the Kollwitz told the Guardian (each member of the Guerrilla Girls takes the name of a dead female artist as a pseudonym). ¡§We figured there had to be a better way of getting people¡¦s attention, to prove to people that the art world is not the meritocracy that everyone thought it was.¡¨These women ¡V and dozens more ¡V would later fuse forces to become a legendary DIY art group, making a career out of the art of protest.They¡¦re called the Guerrilla Girls, a collective that has been active since 1985. Just recently, they have released a book, a retrospective of sorts, entitled Guerrilla Girls: The Art Of Behaving Badly, which features over 200 artworks by the group, who have pasted up thousands of feminist posters across the globe, with scathing discrimination statistics.¡§We wanted to see all our work together in one book, we haven¡¦t done a book like this,¡¨ said Kollwitz. ¡§It¡¦s a journey through our artwork, the same issues and political art we¡¦ve been doing since the beginning in 1985.¡¨The book attempts to rewrite art history that has erased female artists, as well as people of color, many of whom have been left outside of the art world canon ¡V especially when it comes to museums.¡§We feel museums have a duty to tell the real story of art history, not just the white male artist part,¡¨ said ¡§Frida Kahlo¡¨, one of the group¡¦s co-founders. ¡§Our goal is always to twist an issue around and present it in a way, so you think about it differently.¡¨Their real names are secret and they wear masks, to ¡§conceal their identities and focus on the issues, rather than their personalities¡¨, they write on their website.Over the course of 35 years, more than 100 women have joined their collective, creating poster paste-ups, billboards, protests, books and projects, all armed with a feminist message, one aimed to trigger social change. Sort of like art world superheroes, they call themselves ¡§feminist masked avengers¡¨.Their formula is as such: ¡§Writing a killer headline, using killer statistics and crazy visuals,¡¨ said Kollwitz. ¡§We really just kept on doing that. In time, it really has added up to something that has an effect.¡¨It led to their early 1985 posters, which read: ¡§How many women had one-person exhibitions at NYC museums last year?¡¨The Guggenheim, MET and Whitney were all listed scoring as ¡§0¡¨, with the MoMA having a meager ¡§1¡¨.Another poster the same year, took a stab at commercial art galleries, listing those that show no more than 10% female artists (or none at all). ¡§All hell broke loose,¡¨ said Kollwitz. ¡§From the time our first posters went up in 1985, it was a breath of fresh air for artists who were struggling and not getting any appreciation. We keep making trouble, keep upending the art world¡¦s notions of what is good and what is right.¡¨While the group has unveiled a dark side of art world, have they seen much change over the past 35 years? ¡§It¡¦s always two steps forward one step back,¡¨ says Kollwitz. ¡§The changes aren¡¦t great, but we are in a moment where museums are playing catch-up and collecting work by artists of color. That¡¦s a change, but will they stick with it? Many of their collections don¡¦t have people of color or women at all.¡¨In a recent report, only 11% of art acquired by America¡¦s top museums, between 2008 and 2018, was by female artists.Why would artists be so afraid to make trouble and speak up about this? ¡§There¡¦s so few people who pull the strings, that¡¦s why,¡¨ notes Kahlo. ¡§It¡¦s a smaller place than you imagine when you climb that ladder.¡¨One of the artworks in the book is a piece called the Guerrilla Girls¡¦ 1986 Report Card, which lists 17 gallerists and their representation of women artists. With cursive handwriting, each gallery is scrutinized for their lack of improvements in showing women artists.¡§Diane Brown: Could do even better,¡¨ they write like a fourth-grade teacher, comparing each gallerist with their programming from the previous year.¡§Mary Boone: Boy Crazy,¡¨ noting that she showed zero women artists over two years.¡§Pat Hearn: Delinquent,¡¨ the note, following the same pattern.¡§It was a parody of an elementary school postcard,¡¨ said Kollwitz, looking back. ¡§We were always scolding the art world, so here we are being the teachers, showing how poorly they were all doing.¡¨Probably their most famous piece is a 1989 poster of a reclining nude woman wearing a gorilla mask, which asks: ¡§Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?¡¨ detailing that: ¡§Less than 5% of the artists in the modern art section are women, but 85% of the nudes are female.¡¨In another piece, a poster from 1990, their Guerrilla Girls pop quiz asks: ¡§If February is black history month and March is women¡¦s history month, what happens the rest of the year?¡¨ The answer: ¡§Discrimination.¡¨They have focused on the art market for a reason. ¡§The art world has become a market-based place,¡¨ Kahlo says. ¡§We started going after museums, which are meant to be democratic educational institutions, because that¡¦s where art collectors go to appreciate the value of their collections and buy influence, get insider trading and artwash their bad reputations by appearing to support culture.¡¨The group has squarely focused on museum boards, something that has recently come under fire, like museums cutting ties with the Sackler family, who have links to the ongoing opioid crisis, or the Whitney Museum of American Art¡¦s trustees board member Warren Kanders, who resigned last year after controversy around his connections to weapons manufacturing. More recently, Tom Gores, a former board member of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art resigned after it was revealed he invested in a phone company that charges unregulated premiums to jail inmates.¡§It¡¦s a dark corner of the art world,¡¨ said Kahlo. ¡§A lot of people giving money to boards don¡¦t make their money in nice ways. They manufacture weapons of state control, they push opioid drugs, it¡¦s a huge problem. They sit on museum boards to make it all look good.¡¨While many people on museum boards have been forced to resign due to the work of the Guerrilla Girls and other artist-activist protest groups, like Decolonize This Place and the Feminist Art Coalition, the group have been behind milestones in art history, alongside the Riot Grrrl movement, Women Artists in Revolution, the Sister Serpents art group and the New York Feminist Art Institute.But unlike many others, they wanted to remain anonymous. ¡§We wanted to create the idea that we are everywhere, and we are listening,¡¨ said Kollwitz. ¡§We could be working at the MoMA or even at Leo Castelli¡¦s gallery. We wanted to create this idea that the art world was being watched, surveilled and scrutinized. Anonymity has protected us, but now I¡¦m not sure anyone cares any more who we are. It has changed.¡¨What also has changed is the role of the artist-activist, and the amount of resistance art that has sprung up under the Trump administration.¡§Before, there was a lot of disbelief and antagonism to anyone standing up to institutions and calling out discriminations,¡¨ said Kollwitz.¡§It¡¦s an amazing time for activism,¡¨ she adds. ¡§There¡¦s so many activists in the political art and cultural realm, that we¡¦re all pushing progress forward and protesting all the horrible things that are happening.¡¨',\n",
              " 'An open letter signed by more than 300 artists, including several former Turner prize winners, in support of striking Tate workers has demanded the organisation uses 10% of the 7m it received from the government to stop redundancies.Last year¡¦s four Turner prize winners, 2008 winner Mark Leckey and fourth plinth artist Heather Phillipson are among the signatories, who support the letter PDF which says ¡§multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multilingual, workers from low-income backgrounds¡¨ will be cut out of the arts sector without action.The workers, who are on strike over the 313 job cuts across Tate Enterprises (TEL), say the money awarded to the organisation as part of the government¡¦s 1.57bn arts support package is not being used to save jobs and ¡§the most precarious workers across the culture sector will be expected to pay for the Covid-19 crisis¡¨.They urge TEL to stop the redundancy process immediately and to ¡§start exploring new imaginative ways to save jobs and avoid outsourcing¡¨. Tate has previously given TEL 5m from its reserves which Tate said has ¡§prevented the TEL business from closing with the loss of all jobs¡¨, but the workers are calling for funds to be used to save existing roles.¡§We demand that there are no redundancies while senior staff earn more than 100,000,¡¨ the letter continues. ¡§Just 10% of the Tate¡¦s 7m government bailout would be enough to save many of the TEL jobs. If the money isn¡¦t enough, then Tate must demand more funding.¡¨In response Tate said the decision to restructure TEL was a ¡§last resort¡¨ and that it is offering preferential treatment to those made redundant for any vacancies at Tate. It added that with drastically reduced visitor numbers, ¡§there is simply not enough work to employ the same number of people in our shops and catering outlets as before¡¨.A spokesperson for Tate said: ¡§Tate is facing a 50m shortfall in self-generated income this year. We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of this, including on jobs. We are halving all budgets, freezing all but essential recruitment, a voluntary 10% pay cut has been taken by the executive group, and we continue to argue for more government support.¡¨The redundancies ¡V almost half of Tate Enterprise¡¦s workforce ¡V were called ¡§incredibly disappointing¡¨ by the PCS union, which said they will disproportionately affect the lowest paid and the most diverse TEL teams.The Tate recently faced criticism over its links to the patron Anthony d¡¦Offay after it expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Its critics posted a selfie on social media that D¡¦Offay had taken in 2017 of himself posing in a mirror with a golliwog.The Tate responded to accusations of hypocrisy by saying: ¡§We do not condone racist imagery, abuse or discrimination inside Tate, our galleries or digital platforms.¡¨ The Tate has since cut all ties with the benefactor.',\n",
              " 'What if we didn¡¦t erect statues to people, or events of note? That instead of waiting generations to celebrate a significant historical person (which ¡V as recent events have demonstrated ¡V we could later regret), we construct modern monuments to everything and nothing, right now? These are the sculptures of Pakistani-American artist Huma Bhabha, transforming the Baltic gallery in Gateshead into a treasure trove of arresting memorials that embody a past crumbling world, a present rubbish-ridden land and a future state populated by sci-fi monsters.Bhabha¡¦s towering figures are raised up collectively on a plinth in the centre of the space, bearing down on us with their hollowed-out eyes and stocky statures. Eventually feeling brave enough to approach one of the two-metre totems, I am struck by the exquisite carving that turns these lumpy structures into detailed, mythical beings with skeletal faces, neat ribs, kneecaps and bottoms. With legs constructed from recycled cork and torsos from found Styrofoam, this community of monuments celebrates materiality while condemning waste, reflecting the artist¡¦s awareness of the environmental impact of her art.Perhaps it is due to the recent lack of mass gatherings, but Against Time creates the unnerving sensation of being continually observed. Around the edge of the space are collections of photo-drawings and prints, primarily of skull-like faces. A row of colourful ink and pastel collages see heads overlaid with the faces of animals. Human fuses with creature, aligning the existence and importance of the two. Elsewhere a row of nine monochrome faces form a haunting lineup. Inspired by cinema, Bhabha creates smudged skulls with empty eyes and silent mouths to form the cast of an Edvard Munch-style horror film.The artist makes us work hard. Atlas ¡V a low structure made from battered tyres and metal ¡V has the illusion of being an alligator rising from a swamp, but from the viewing station above it morphs into a human figure. In combination with the title Atlas, the work could be a man trudging a trashed planet, an animal fighting for survival or a map of an apocalyptic future. Even the materiality of forms is not clear. The Joke seems to be a piece of Styrofoam packaging but is actually bronze, likewise the artist¡¦s recent outdoor sculpture, Receiver, is bronze despite appearing a blend of Styrofoam and cork. Never completely sure what we¡¦re perceiving, Against Time invites us to mine our own experiences for context, placing us as active participants rather than passive onlookers.Downstairs, an entirely different exhibition is taking place. The Making of Husbands: Christina Ramberg in Dialogue is a solo show inside a group show. Named after a BBC documentary on the making of John Cassavetes¡¦s 1970 film Husbands, The Making of Husbands follows the documentary¡¦s exploration of performed identity. Joined by 12 other artists, including contemporaries and younger practitioners, the Chicago Imagist¡¦s understanding of dress as a form of manipulation remains a current concern, almost 50 years later.Drawing together Ramberg¡¦s precise paintings of torsos and bound bodies from the 1970s and 80s, the show takes us on a journey from her early preoccupation with the pushing and pulling of female bodies to more androgynous ones. Intrigued by the corsets her mother used to wear, Ramberg¡¦s initial sensual works feature snippets of lace, beading, hair and material placed carefully against skin. Later, these textures reappear but in a less conventional sense, with waists bound by hair and fabrics becoming indistinguishable from the limbs they depict. Enhanced by the presentation of several study drawings of garments, the paintings demonstrate Ramberg¡¦s interest not with the physicality of the body, but with our tireless pursuit to command it via various props.Surrounding Ramberg¡¦s paintings are several pieces of adornment from other artists, such as Diane Simpson¡¦s wooden skirt and vest, Alexandra Bircken¡¦s wig-accessorised motorbike suit and Ana Pellicer¡¦s to-scale ring for the Statue of Liberty. While looking at these familiar items ¡V now reformatted in oversized and impractical materials ¡V I am suddenly conscious of my own clothing and appearance, and the necklace I carefully selected that morning to perform my identity as ¡§art critic¡¨ feels weighty.Wider society is instrumental in either affirming or rejecting identities, and Howardena Pindell¡¦s short film Free, White and 21, excellently portrays the damage done when certain bodies are excluded from perceived ¡§norms¡¨. Pindell tells personal stories of racism, all of them exposing how stereotypes blocked her from education, work, parties and ¡V in one case ¡V going to the toilet. A patronising white character responds: ¡§You really must be paranoid. I¡¦ve never had an experience like that.¡¨ This statement is key to understanding The Making of Husbands ¡V beyond the literal restriction of a corset ¡V fundamentally, it is the collective experience of society that is the repressive force in telling us who we can and can¡¦t be.',\n",
              " 'In his painting for the cover of the June edition of Time magazine, published in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, American artist Titus Kaphar portrayed the pain of the grieving African-American mother.Eyes closed, a black woman in a pose evocative of the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, holds an outline where her child should be. The painting made Kaphar a figure of hate for some, who felt it had no place on the front of the prestigious publication. ¡§It became a place to put their anger and frustration,¡¨ he says. ¡§It was another example of how Black Lives Matter was destroying the country.¡¨Kaphar¡¦s latest exhibition, The Evidence of Things Unseen, staged by the Maruani Mercier gallery in a deconsecrated church in Belgium ¡V the country of Jan van Eyck and Peter Paul Rubens ¡V is likely to be no less challenging to some. By grappling with the representation of race in renaissance religious iconography and art, he is exploring his own pain over an absence: the absence of those who look like him from the canvases of the venerated European masters of his own trade.Kaphar¡¦s works attempt to insert that experience, asking the viewer to adjust their gaze, rethink what they are seeing. In his hands, a reproduction of a painting by the 19th century French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, depicting Jesus handing the keys to heaven to St Peter, becomes something else.A portrait of a young black man is taped to the surface of the painting over Christ¡¦s face in ¡§a gesture that feels almost like graffiti¡¨, Kaphar says. ¡§It is all those feelings that I was feeling spending time in European museums and longing for pictures that looked like they actually made space for individuals that look like me.¡¨ Christ¡¦s outstretched right hand, originally pointing to the heavens, now appears as a plea for help.The show in the former Jesuit Ges? church in the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode district of Brussels, running from 16 October to 28 November, has the potential to stir emotions in a country where the issue of race and discrimination remains an undeveloped debate. Last year, a UN working group of experts on people of African descent said that racial discrimination and marginalisation against Africans remained ¡§endemic¡¨ in Belgium.Kaphar, based in New Haven, Connecticut, has faced angry rejection in the past. A painting entitled Behind the Myth of Benevolence, featuring a black woman peering out from behind a rumpled canvas on which is painted a portrait of Thomas Jefferson, was damaged three times when on display at the Smithsonian in New York. A security guard had to stand beside it for the rest of the exhibition.But, for all the regret Kaphar, 44, had initially felt when cast into the public eye by the Time cover, the issues of absence and pain are his stock in trade. Shying away from difficulty would be ¡§unacceptable¡¨, says the father of two young sons. ¡§My regret was erased when I received a letter from a black mother who had lost her son. After seeing the Time magazine cover, she said she had been searching for an image that reflected her loss and pain, and she hadn¡¦t found it until she saw my painting.¡¨He says he is ¡§fascinated¡¨ by angry responses. Kaphar, whose mother was 14 when she fell pregnant with him, says he has no interest in attacking Christian communities for their beliefs and narratives.His grandfather was a minister, as was his father ¡§before he fell off the wagon¡¨ in drug-flooded Michigan of the 1980s. He and his mother were taken in by a devout Christian family when they later moved to California. ¡§I was raised in the tradition,¡¨ he says.His work, he says, is not about erasing or rewriting history. ¡§My whole strategy is not about destroying the path, tearing it all down. The reality is that in order to make what I make, I have to study and understand this traditional technique of making paintings before I alter and revise it in order to say something about where we are in this moment.¡¨Kaphar rejects the framing of the debate about statues of now controversial figures such as the English slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol or Leopold II, the King of the Belgians, who murderously plundered the Congo. ¡§We are having a binary conversation about the sculptures and it goes something like: keep it up or take it down,¡¨ he says. ¡§In a binary conversation, I take it down. But I think having it as a binary conversation lacks creativity.¡¨¡§I think some of these sculptures are of detestable characters and some are detestable in the quality of their art itself,¡¨ he says. ¡§These characters represented are something we are realising that we don¡¦t esteem, but the answer doesn¡¦t just need to be to destroy them. These sculptures seem very loud right now because they are the only voice in the room. So one way to dim the volume is to bring other pieces to the public square. What we would have is sculpture that represents where we came from, and then you will have a sculpture of where we are and where we want to be.¡¨The difference between the debate in the US and Europe is telling, he adds. In Europe, the public sculptures are of those who were victors in war and trade. ¡§It is odd in the United States that in many cases the sculpture we are debating are erected in honour of individuals who were in protest to the principles of what has become the United States. These sculptures are erected of people who would have been charged with sedition. They lost. The majority of the sculptures were also not erected at the time of the people they are honouring. They were erected in the 1930s and 1940s when there was a backlash against black people. And that is the part that I have a problem with.¡¨',\n",
              " 'Our cities are dominated by glass-faced edifices that overheat like greenhouses then guzzle energy to cool down. Instead, we could have buildings that are intimately connected to the living systems that have evolved with us, that celebrate the human-nature connection that is central to our wellbeing.As more of us in Australia live in urban areas and our cities grow, bringing nature into our cities is a key part of establishing and rebuilding that connection. As well as bringing beauty into urban environments, we know that people are healthier when they are connected to nature. Research also shows that crime rates decrease in areas with street trees and that property values increase.Nature knows how to manage flooding and weather events and is more adaptable than many of our engineered systems, yet we refuse to learn from it. As we grapple with changing the way that we live due to climate change, we have an opportunity to learn from both the natural systems and Indigenous cultures that have mastered managing and supporting the diversity of Australia for thousands of years.The ¡§Greener Places¡¨ framework, released by the government architect of New South Wales last year, outlines the many benefits of green infrastructure; from increased social interaction and inclusion to reduced flood risk and improved property values. With all this knowledge about the benefits of nature in cities, we are still seeing developments that have little to no nature and if they do, there is very limited thought given to the creation of habitats that can increase biodiversity. A regenerative design approach, one that creates opportunities for people and nature to thrive together, is emerging as a way forward as is the biophilic cities movement that began in the US and is now present in Australia.Our cities could be rewilded and become habitats for native species everywhere, even in the densest of city centre environments, while also creating engaging community spaces for people. As Australian cities become denser, the benefits of connecting to nature increase, yet we often tell ourselves that it is not possible to bring nature into the city, that it requires too much space or is best left to the creation of parks where it can stay separate from our built spaces.Biodiversity exists everywhere, even the smallest urban green spaces provide essential habitats for the most minute of species. If we manage to link those small spaces together, then the potential increases. Fortunately, we are seeing projects emerging in cities around the world that demonstrate the possibilities.High-profile projects like the Highline in New York City provide examples to cities elsewhere for how leftover spaces in cities can be completely transformed to connect both people and nature. Rewilding is about adding nature everywhere, not just in parks, by using nature-based solutions or green infrastructure at the edges of our streets, in leftover spaces and on and within our buildings. If we viewed our developments as spaces for nature, from which we cut out the spaces for human use rather than ones where we design for human use and add a token amount of green to them at the edge, we will have a chance at bringing people and nature into a healthy balance.Our cities in Australia are teeming with leftover spaces, from railway cuttings to car parks and abandoned industrial sites. All too often our busiest roads are hostile environments with little to no nature and our cities rooftops and plazas are hard surfaces that contribute to increased heat and polluted water runoff. The nature that we add does not just need to be trees, projects like Sydney¡¦s Camperdown Commons, Perth City Farm or Melbourne¡¦s SkyFarm demonstrate the opportunity to grow food in our cities while simultaneously growing community interaction and engagement.There are many ambitions within our cities to create blue/green grids and several plans, frameworks and guidelines that outline the opportunities and benefits. The City of Melbourne¡¦s Green Our City strategic action plan outlines how green walls and roofs can play a part in bringing nature into the city, for example. What we are lacking is the wide-spread integration of these frameworks into the actual designing and engineering of our cities as well as the economic will to hand over some space to nature.We are typically shortsighted and unable to see the benefits that nature provides us in the long-term. Too often we do not conduct an economic benefit analysis of the increased property values, reduction of pollutants in waterways, and cleaner air that results from these measures. Several high-profile building projects in Sydney and Melbourne have led the way in exploring how to include nature. The planned Green Spine project in Melbourne integrates nature as a defining design feature and the successful One Central Park project in Sydney provides a vibrant urban greening example that takes nature up from the ground plane on to its facade. A movement that demonstrates regenerative thinking is showing signs of emergence.The bones are there for the rewilding of our cities to become a reality. Government frameworks, commitments and priorities acknowledge the benefits, we have built examples that can act as catalyst projects for others, and time is becoming critical both in regard to climate change and biodiversity loss, issues that polls consistently show are of high importance to Australians. Let¡¦s hope that more species becoming extinct, devastating bushfires, catastrophic floods and chaotic demonstrations of changing weather patterns do not need to happen for us to take action.A decade ago the UN convention set targets for biodiversity ¡V alarmingly, none of them have been achieved. In the next decade, we must embrace our responsibility to support nature to thrive, the survival of all other species on which we depend, lies in our hands. Over the last 200 years, Australia has lost 75% of its rainforests and has the world¡¦s worst record of mammal extinctions. While we continue to see nature as something that we can take and destroy and as something that it is separate to us, it is unlikely that anything will change. Here in Australia, even the threat of koala extinction after last year¡¦s bushfires has not resulted in sufficient action.Fundamentally our relationship to nature is key to this change, we need to embrace nature in our everyday lives and act with the knowledge that whatever we do to nature, we do to ourselves.',\n",
              " 'It was designed to make sharpening a pencil feel as thrilling as flying a jet. A gleaming chrome teardrop, tapered to a point and adorned with a bullet-like handle, Raymond Loewy¡¦s aerodynamic tail-fin pencil sharpener brought the glamour of the machine age to the humble office desk.As the godfather of American industrial design, Loewy gave his streamlined signature to trains, planes and Coca-Cola vending machines, defining the sleek art deco look of the 1930s. But his go-faster pencil sharpener never made it into production, deemed one chrome-plated, deco-styled step too far. The design does survive in the form of its patent, filed in 1933 and now republished as one of 1,000 such protected inventions, brought together in a new book.¡§Design critics trashed Loewy¡¦s sharpener,¡¨ says Thomas Rinaldi, author of the Patented: 1,000 Design Patents. ¡§A pencil sharpener doesn¡¦t have to fly through the air, they said, so why make it aerodynamic?¡¨ But the design went on to become an icon of the streamlined era. The prototype sold for 85,000 at auction in 2001 and, despite the innumerable designs that Loewy realised throughout his career, it was the phantom pencil sharpener that was chosen to honour him on a celebratory postage stamp in 2011.Featured among everyday classics like the ring-pull can and the cassette tape, the sharpener is one of a number of designs in the book that never made it off the drawing board. From a flying automobile-cum-helicopter designed in 1959 to the ill-fated Google Glass wearable display of 2011, it seems designers¡¦ ambitions have often been ahead of what is technologically feasible ¡V or practically desirable. ¡§Sifting through the archives,¡¨ says Rinaldi, ¡§it became clear that design patents have often been used as a publicity tool. Someone would design a crazy thing, without having a manufacturer on board, so they could shop it around and get it published in magazines to raise their profile. For a lot of designers, patenting was a vanity exercise.¡¨Arranged chronologically from 1900 to the present day, one patent per page, the book presents a fascinating cross-section through more than a century of material culture, the simple black and white line drawings reflecting the changing tastes and technologies of the decades. Drawn from around 800,000 designs registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office, the catalogue of objects reflects not only the onset of mass manufacture, the rise of electrical appliances and the later ubiquity of personal electronics, but it also reveals a story of international trade and shifting global power.We see how US-created designs for cars and appliances were overtaken by innovations from Japan in the 1970s and 80s and, more recently, an influx from China ¡V with a sixfold increase in filings from Chinese companies and inventors over the last decade. On a stylistic level, we see how the rich ornamentation of the 1900s gives way to the streamlining of the 30s, and how the angular forms of the 70s melt into chubby postmodern products of the 80s.One surprise inclusion, among the scores of gadgets and appliances, is patented building designs ¡V a phenomenon that coincided with the birth of roadside fast-food joints and gas stations, designed like 3D billboards to be easily recognisable from a moving car. Who could resist pulling in to refuel beneath one of Eliot Noyes¡¦ 1966 UFO-like canopies for Mobil (one of which remains on the A6 at Birstall, Leicestershire, safely listed in 2012)?A section at the front of the book shows the evolution of particular products, which reads like Darwinian natural selection. The mobile phone arrives as an enormous brick in the 70s, before gradually shrinking towards the tiny palm-sized flip-phone of the early 00s, then swelling into vast touch-screen slabs too big for most pockets, before coming full circle and ending with a basic, compact model, with analogue buttons and a small LCD screen ¡V part of a backlash against the always-connected smartphone lifestyle. The food mixer goes through similar convulsions, travelling from industrial-looking machine, through futuristic streamlined forms, and back again, concluding with a retro model patented in 2019 that doesn¡¦t look too far from the first 1927 version.One thing that remains eerily consistent is the visual style of the patent drawings. When design patents were introduced in the late 19th century, the illustrations had to withstand reproduction at reduced scale in periodically issued gazettes, and the standard has remained the same ever since. Whether depicting the design for a Victorian billiard table or a Pizza Hut restaurant building, a Rolodex card file or a Chinese drone, each item is drawn with the same objective black lines, floating against a white background. Stripped of all context, their very essence distilled, the objects take on an almost totemic quality. Even a novelty pig-shaped clock, with hands emerging from its rear, starts to look like a design classic.The book also shines a useful spotlight on unsung heroes behind the items we use every day. ¡§I¡¦d never heard of Jean Reinecke before I started this research,¡¨ says Rinaldi. ¡§But it turns out he probably designed three quarters of all the tape dispensers you¡¦ve ever touched. Or there¡¦s Ray Patten, an in-house designer at General Electric who designed everything from kitchen timers to locomotives. Or Charles McLeod, who designed dozens of electric clocks.¡¨ It was Rinaldi¡¦s own considerable collection of clocks, radios, lamps and other flea-market finds that first prompted him to find out more about the anonymous designers behind these products, beginning the years-long process of whittling down the selection for the book.He traces the origins of design patents back to the birth of mass production, when industrialised processes of casting, stamping, weaving and cutting enabled objects to be produced at scale for the first time ¡V as well as more easily copied. ¡§Utility patents¡¨ had been around since the 1790s, but they regulated how an invention functioned, not how it looked, and proved ill-suited to protecting a new age of designed products.Introduced in 1842, the US design patent law saw just 14 designs registered in its first year, including a typeface, a bathtub and a ¡§corpse preserver¡¨. By 1930, the patent office was issuing 3,000 design patents a year, and 6,500 by 1941, a figure that wasn¡¦t exceeded until 1989. That number has now mushroomed to around 35,000 ¡V good news for lawyers, but maybe less so for innovators.The recent boom in design patents has mostly come from the electronics sphere, spurred on by a landmark supreme court case between Apple and Samsung, which began in 2011 and was finally settled in 2018, when Apple was awarded 539m in damages. The case revolved around Apple claiming Samsung had copied numerous elements of the iPhone, from its ¡§bounce-back scrolling¡¨ interface to the ¡§rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded¡¨.Design patent lawsuits had never seen such vast sums awarded, so the shock ruling sparked an explosion in tech companies racing to patent every last detail of their devices, from the internal components of hardware to the user interface designs displayed on screen. As Florian M?ller, intellectual property activist and author of a patents blog, puts it: ¡§The number of patents in a phone is so huge that nobody has ever been able to count.¡¨The unprecedented ruling unleashed an arms race, with big tech companies amassing vast arsenals of pre-emptive patents, conceived as assets to be sold or traded, as well as providing an insurance policy against any potential litigation. If someone sues you for infringement, you are more likely to be able to countersue for one of the thousands of other patents in your possession.While providing protection on one hand, this thicket of patents also serves to stifle innovation. As patent law professor Michael A Carrier remarked in response to the Apple ruling: ¡§There¡¦s always the trade-off between litigation and innovation, and in the time these companies spent in the courtroom, they weren¡¦t innovating.¡¨Still, in centuries to come, at least the inexorable archive of patent drawings will provide a useful insight into the lengths our species went to protect the monetisable details of smartphone packaging and poop emojis.',\n",
              " 'Fire engine red, bordered by polka dots and stretching the length of three cars, the sign for the Orte clothing store had long loomed over Madrid¡¦s Alcal? thoroughfare, its presence steady even as fast-food restaurants and chain stores began moving into the area.When the store closed its doors and the space was poised to be rented, news swiftly reached Alberto Nanclares. Within days he was on site, working with a team to painstakingly pry the sign from the facade where it had sat for more than five decades.Nanclares is part of the Iberian Network in Defence of Graphic Heritage, a loose assembly of more than 50 projects that celebrate and safeguard a form of heritage they say is increasingly under threat: the commercial signs that have long shaped the identity of cities.¡§Everyone sees these signs but few give them much thought,¡¨ said Nanclares, whose rescue work is carried out under the banner of the Paco Graco project. ¡§When these signs are thrown away, the history of these shops, their clients and their owners disappear. The memory of our cities is thrown away.¡¨The projects housed within the network vary widely ¡V from those that salvage signs with hopes of one day opening a museum, like Nanclares, to those that catalogue signs ranging from century-old enamels to gaudy neons, creating a living archive that spans 25 cities and towns across the peninsula.Central to the network is the idea that heritage is about not just palaces, cathedrals and royal jewels but also the places that shape our lives and define our identities ¡V a sort of heritage for the rest of us, said Nanclares. ¡§There is little notion in Spain that this is heritage, that this should be something that unites us, that allows us to advance and to better understand ourselves.¡¨Inspired in part by museums dedicated to signs in Berlin and Warsaw, the Iberian movement has taken on new significance as the region reels from a series of recent economic downturns ¡V from the 2008 financial crisis to the destruction wreaked by the pandemic ¡V that have transformed cityscapes.As small businesses close, they¡¦re often replaced by a familiar roster of global behemoths with little connection to the city, said Laura Asensio, a graphic designer based in the north-western Spanish city of Valladolid.She pointed to changes sweeping through city centres across Spain. ¡§Whether you¡¦re in Madrid, Barcelona or Salamanca, the urban iconography that we see is practically the same,¡¨ said Asensio. ¡§There¡¦s always a McDonald¡¦s, a Zara ¡K It¡¦s a pity because cities lose their charm.¡¨Asensio¡¦s project, Valladolid with Character, aims to stave off some of this homogeneity with an interactive map of more than 1,000 singular signs across the city. Compiled by a team, the map marks out everything from the neon-red bus stop sign that for decades has greeted weary travellers at the local bus station to the giant calligraphy pen that dominates the sign for a shop specialising in fountain pens.In Lisbon, Rita M?rias and Paulo Barata launched their project in 2014, as souvenir shops and crepe stands were relentlessly proliferating across the city. ¡§We started as designers looking for lettering and then we realised that the signs capture the stories of the owners of the shop and people¡¦s memories,¡¨ said M?rias. ¡§People tell you of visiting these shops with their grandmother or when they were a child. They connect the place with the memory.¡¨They soon began using their spare time and their own funds to rescue signs from businesses that were closing. Their project, Letreiro Galeria, has now amassed a collection of 250 signs that sit in a borrowed warehouse space as the pair work towards their dream of one day opening a museum.Around 90% of the signs they¡¦ve collected are neon, hinting at the radical changes that have swept across the city in recent years. ¡§Until the 80s there were lots of neon signs in Lisbon,¡¨ said M?rias. Many were cast aside as the city weathered successive financial crises, gentrification and a boom in tourism.Every part of a sign ¡V from the typeface to materials such as ceramics and gold leaf lettering ¡V is the result of a personal decision, offering a window into how broad themes such as the economy are playing out in people¡¦s lives at any given moment, said Rosa L?pez, a graphic designer whose Carril Conga project has been spotlighting signs seen across Madrid since 2015.¡§Trends come and go, but there¡¦s always decisions when it comes to materials or durability,¡¨ she said. ¡§Often these decisions don¡¦t go unnoticed ¡V sometime when you see a neon sign, you think: madre mia, what are they selling here?¡¨While some cities have enacted legislation to protect emblematic signs, members of the network hope that their efforts will cultivate a deeper appreciation and understanding of this heritage, perhaps convincing some to leave signs where they are even as new shops and services move in.¡§It¡¦s a labour of consciousness-raising. It¡¦s interesting to see how people react when they follow me on Instagram and they see photos of signs rather than selfies or nights out,¡¨ said L?pez. ¡§But then they start sending me photos of signs they notice while travelling. It¡¦s contagious.¡¨',\n",
              " 'Passersby in Manhattan¡¦s Meatpacking District will see something rather atypical in one of the many storefronts at the moment: a group of old-fashioned lightbulbs standing alongside small internet-connected printers, each unspooling an anonymous newsfeed of survivor stories.It¡¦s part of a new project from New York City¡¦s commission on human rights¡¦ public artist-in-residence, Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, an installation called May We Know Our Own Strength, which highlights the voices of anonymous survivors of racism and sexual violence. It runs until 15 May.¡§Last summer, we experienced a watershed moment where Asian and Pacific Islander youth were coming forward with their stories of sexual assault and gender-based violence,¡¨ said the artist.¡§I wanted to create a space where private sorrow could still see the light of day for anyone carrying heavy burdens to lay them down; a reassuring ritual that lets survivors know that their stories will be held with dignity and respect.¡¨With protesters gathering around the country in an outcry to the Asian and Pacific Islander community, Phingbodhipakkiya wanted to help break the silence. Anyone can visit the artist¡¦s website, MayWeKnow.NYC, and submit their story of survival; be it of sexual assault or gender-based violence. She performs a ritual to honor the Asian women recently murdered in Atlanta every night at 8pm, and viewers can watch the space via a 24-hour live stream.The artwork will grow organically over time depending on the submissions received through the website, which are then printed out (so far, there have been 500 submissions). ¡§Each week, I harvest armfuls of anger, hope, grief, loss and shame and begin to weave them into the installation,¡¨ said Phingbodhipakkiya.She uses the printed-out papers as a kind of sculpture or textile, sometimes cutting them up and weaving them into wire structures or hanging them from above. Sometimes, they are laid alongside warm-colored lights, candles and dried flowers (Phingbodhipakkiya used flowers as symbolic of solidarity and resilience as part of her recent Time magazine cover, which she illustrated, as well). It embodies a sense of solitude and silence.¡§So much of this work is a meditation on how we can still bloom and grow after trauma,¡¨ she said. ¡§Like the unpredictable nature of healing from trauma, the finished installation may end up being something unexpected.¡¨Phingbodhipakkiya wanted to pay tribute to the six Asian women who were victims of the Atlanta hate crime, having grown up in the city. ¡§We can¡¦t discuss this tragedy without talking about the deadly intersection of racism and misogyny, and how the fetishization and exoticization of Asian women isn¡¦t some abstract theory,¡¨ she said. ¡§It has violent real-world consequences.¡¨Every night, Phingbodhipakkiya visits the space to dim the lightbulbs in the installation and print their names out: Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Soon Chung Park, Yong Ae Yue, Paul Andre Michels and Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonz?lez. ¡§And all 16 incandescent bulbs shine resolutely into the darkness,¡¨ she said.The stories from survivors keep coming in, and every time they are submitted through the website, they are printed in real-time through one of the 16 internet-connected printers onsite.One story, which brought Phingbodhipakkiya to tears, reads: ¡§I am a survivor of sexual abuse. My older male cousin molested me when I was 12. What makes this even more complicated is that he is from the AAPI side of my family, so I often find myself struggling to accept that the source of my connection to this beautiful community also contains my greatest wound. I want to believe that there is a greater purpose, an opportunity to turn this pain into something creative and healing for others. I don¡¦t know what that is yet. But I hope for it every single day.¡¨Phingbodhipakkiya has used recycled materials from the city¡¦s Materials for the Arts program, which allows artists to reuse donated secondhand materials. It includes an old clock, which she claims is a nod to #MeToo and the Time¡¦s Up movement. ¡§It¡¦s also a way to acknowledge the staggering Rainn statistic that every 73 seconds in America, someone is sexually assaulted,¡¨ she said. ¡§That¡¦s why the clock is always set at 7.30, because it is always time to believe survivors and support their healing.¡¨This project, created in partnership with the local Business Improvement District and the city¡¦s commission on human rights, is what the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, Gonzalo Casals, calls ¡§transforming the all-too-often invisible experiences of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence into something that must be acknowledged and addressed¡¨. Presenting an exhibit that uses paper requires a double take: paper can be seen as a material easily torn. However, Phingbodhipakkiya still sees it as a symbol of strength and resilience.¡§A single sheet of paper may be flimsy, but with every fold, it grows in strength, just as we do with support, encouragement and resources,¡¨ said the artist. ¡§Paper that has been folded 100 times over is nearly impossible to tear, just as survivors standing together in support of each other and bearing witness to each other¡¦s stories is formidable.¡¨Phingbodhipakkiya sits on the cold concrete floor to read the submissions, rip them off the roll of paper and work with them. ¡§I am physically holding someone¡¦s story in my hands, I don¡¦t take that lightly,¡¨ she said. ¡§Each time I bend, fold and twist the paper, I feel like I¡¦m helping to release a long-held burden. I¡¦ve found that process incredibly cathartic.¡¨Each story is used as a glint of hope. By weaving the stories together, it proves that survivors are not alone, offering a sense of belonging, if not refuge.¡§Art helps us connect to our humanity when we feel it has been stripped away, it helps us find our power and courage when we feel we have been violated or silenced,¡¨ she said.¡§It reminds us that despite the limitations society may put upon us, despite the hardships and heartbreak we have suffered at the hands of others or under oppressive systems, that we are worthy of love, healing and freedom,¡¨ she said. ¡§And its multifaceted nature allows us to mend our wounds at our own pace and in our own way.¡¨',\n",
              " '¡§I am a poster child,¡¨ says David Ogunmuyiwa, ¡§for what you get if you invest in people¡¦s education, healthcare and homes.¡¨ The son of immigrants, he grew up on the Aylesbury estate in south London, the often-vilified place that Tony Blair visited on the morning after his first election as prime minister, as the exemplar of the kind of blighted Britain that he was going to fix. But Ogunmuyiwa, inspired by seeing Richard Rogers¡¦s Lloyd¡¦s building across the river from his school, knew that he wanted to be an architect. Which, as the founder of the practice Architecture Doing Place, he now is.¡§There are hundreds of me,¡¨ he continues, so he questions why he sees so few people like himself in his profession. He criticises the London borough of Hackney, which has a well-respected programme of building housing, but which in one of the most diverse areas of the country ¡§has not employed anyone who looks like Stephen Lawrence¡¨ to design them (the particular significance of the murdered black teenager is that he was planning to become an architect at the time of his death in 1993).Ogunmuyiwa took a detour before he became an architect, working first as a local authority housing officer. He believes he is the only housing officer turned architect in the country. This gives him a unique insight into what is, alongside diversity, one of the issues most motivating architects at present. Housing and race are two different matters, but they also interconnect. They raise in different ways the same question: what exactly can design contribute to larger issues of social justice?Architecture Doing Place is one of 109 of the best emerging British practices in New Architects 4, the latest edition of a ¡§guide for the open-minded client¡¨ that the Architecture Foundation periodically produces. The first came out in 1998, and included several architects that have gone on to be leaders of their profession, including the Stirling prize winners Caruso St John and AHMM, and muf. In some ways the current group is like the first: you see the same striving of talent to get itself seen, through extracting the most out of house extensions and office interiors. Some have proved themselves abroad with projects of a scale that are harder to find here, for example WallaceLiu¡¦s impressive conversion of a former steelworks into the Chongqing Industrial Museum.There is wit, as in Unknown Works¡¦s creation of a British fish and chip shop in Chengdu, China. You find, in Apparata¡¦s House for Artists in Barking, playful shapes of triangles and circles rendered in substantial and sober masonry. You get snapshots of architects¡¦ current explorations in style, such as the precision postmodernism ¡V wherein kitsch colours are arrayed with infinite care ¡V of Office S&M. Some practices, such as Space Popular, achieve architecture that is close in concept and experience to installation art.But the latest New Architects is also different. It is more diverse than its predecessors and displays a changed set of attitudes. The first book came out in the early Blair years, in the shadow of 18 years of Conservative rule, a time when most architects were keen above all to prove themselves as service providers, as trustworthy cogs in the wheels of business. Their self-descriptions tended to stress how well they would meet their clients¡¦ requirements, while adding a vague something extra by way of contemporary stylishness. These are all worthy objectives, but limited ¡V it was almost taboo to suggest that they might play a role in changing society.The latest edition, by contrast, opens with a series of short essays that remind us of monumental crises: climate emergency, Black Lives Matter, Covid, housing shortages, globalised finance. We read about Australian bushfires and the fall of Edward Colston. Most of these issues involve the built environment in some way: housing tends to imply construction, and buildings account for a large proportion of carbon emissions. Statue-toppling involves material objects in physical space. So architects feel that they have something to contribute to addressing these challenges.The hard part is the how. Architects, especially younger and smaller practices, have limited power even within the constraints of a given commission, let alone to challenge the social and economic conditions that lie behind it. There¡¦s also the what: design has a role to play in (for example) using land well or improving energy performance, but the case always has to be made for what difference it makes to arrange building materials one way or another, in the face of colossal global questions.One serious attempt is being made by Common Ground, which describes itself as a new type of practice, set up to ¡§bridge the worlds of private and public sector¡¨. It is part of Brick By Brick, a development company set up by Croydon council to deliver new housing. Most of Common Ground¡¦s work is for this company, but it is free to advise other local authorities as well.It applies a ¡§down to earth, practical¡¨ approach to ¡§characterful and joyful¡¨ projects such as the Pump House residential development in South Norwood, a robust composition of cylinders and oblongs that captures some of the art deco spirit of an Odeon that used to stand next door. Here, design is used to make a tricky site viable, such that it can yield much-needed homes, and to give a sense of pride and care to locations that haven¡¦t had enough of either.Common Ground has also developed commonsense methods such as the standardisation of elements used on different sites, which saves money which can then be spent on better quality finishes and details. It doesn¡¦t just design buildings itself, but also oversees other practices working in Croydon. It is not trying to change the world, but to change the bit of it that it can influence.But even this level-headedness struggles to succeed. Brick By Brick has hit financial problems, as a result of which Croydon council is looking for a buyer to take it off its hands, and a large number of projects have been put on hold. The future of Common Ground is unclear, although one option might be to expand its services to other councils.For Akil Scafe-Smith of the collective Resolve, the architectural profession¡¦s issues are structural. It has taken on too limited an idea of its own role, is too ¡§complicit in the hyper-financialisation of property¡¨, and so its issues of diversity go beyond the representation of minorities among its leaders. ¡§It is not just about changing the faces in architecture but changing architecture.¡¨Resolve¡¦s own work is not currently much concerned with building buildings, which gives it some kind of freedom. It includes an installation in the art centre Kunstverein Braunschweig on the 18th-century African-German philosopher Anton Wilhelm Amo. With another architect, Farouk Agoro, it had a railway bridge in Brixton repainted in Caribbean colours and the words ¡§COME IN LOVE/ STAY IN PEACE¡¨. This, says Scafe-Smith, can be seen as a celebration of Brixton¡¦s African-Caribbean communities and as its memorial, as ¡§rapid gentrification¡¨ changes the area.Resolve and Common Ground enact completely different ways of being an architect. Ogunmuyiwa, who is developing ideas for environmentally friendly housing made of rammed earth, enacts another. But they are all stabs at the same thing, which is how to make the architectural profession into more than another service provider.It would be asking too much of this book to give all the answers, and given the grandiosity of some of the questions asked in its introductory essays, it may be beyond the power of architects ever to find all of them. What it does show are talent, energy and aspirations, clues to an alternative future of architecture. And, given that some of the protagonists of the first book made it to positions of influence, you can hope that some of these will too.',\n",
              " 'During the past year, the beguiling urban designer Thomas Heatherwick has, along with just about everyone else, spent many hours walking alone in empty streets, wondering what happens next. One of the thoughts that has bounced around in his head on those walks has been this: ¡§Many people are realising that they may hardly have to go anywhere ever again.¡¨ A consequence of that realisation ¡V the conclusion of the enforced mass experiment of working and socialising and shopping from your kitchen table ¡V will, he believes, cause ¡§a lot of hard-nosed businessmen¡¨ to confront a question that has been fundamental to his own thinking ever since he set up in practice 27 years ago. ¡§What might make people want to come to this place?¡¨Heatherwick is talking to me from his studio in King¡¦s Cross, London, an area that he is helping to reimagine on a grand scale: his Coal Drops Yard development, an upscale shopping and caf? complex landscaped and wow-factored from blackened-brick Victorian warehousing, opened in 2018; nearby his co-design for the new Google UK campus, a ¡§landscraper¡¨ with a rooftop park, is slowly taking shape. The studio wall behind him is alive with ferns and trailing plants that half-cover schoolroom maps of the world ¡V a potted version of the cascades of foliage and trees that are integrated into many of his city centre designs, including his ill-fated Garden Bridge across the Thames.Heatherwick has so long been thought of as the elfin prodigy of British design, that you have to remind yourself that he is now 51, with a global practice that employs 200 people. Visitors to his studio discover a place that falls somewhere between materials laboratory and medieval workshop, full of animated industry and cabinets of curiosities. During the pandemic he has often been in it pretty much alone.For an instinctive collaborator, that distancing was novel for a while, he says ¡V ¡§we all fed off the nourishment of having worked together for quite a long time¡¨ ¡V but then not so much. ¡§You realise you really need the humour, the accidents of human interaction.¡¨One of his distractions in that period has been work on a book he¡¦s promised to Penguin that pins down some of his design philosophy. His London walks have let him once again count the ways that he dislikes much postwar building ¡V his original vocation, he says a couple of times, was formed as a child when he looked around at ¡§sterile, inhuman¡¨ public places and wondered how they ever got built. The mantra of that modernism was that ¡§form follows function¡¨. ¡§Well, I¡¦m really passionate about function,¡¨ he says, ¡§but for me there was a function that was always being missed, which was emotion. The bit that I¡¦m interested in is, where in the world around us gets love? What I mean by that is, if you walk into an art gallery, surprise, surprise, it¡¦s really artistic.¡¨ Why not, he wonders, build that same artistic surprise into a waste-recycling centre? That desire to spread love to unlikely places produces frequent ¡§roll-our-eyes moments¡¨ in the studio, he says, when his team realises once again that in first sketches of a new project, ¡§there¡¦s a diagram with a heart, the place that brings people together¡¨.In the past, developers and planners, builders of office blocks and shopping malls, could dismiss such sentiment with talk of rigour and efficiencies. The fact was that employees had no choice but to be in the monolithic office from nine until five. ¡§Employers had them in a headlock,¡¨ Heatherwick says. But what if you are only at work for two days, or if you can choose? How do you make people want to come together then?Heatherwick¡¦s answer to that question is that you will have to create spaces built with a care that makes people feel better, more social, for being in them. When I ask how that metric might be calculated, he talks about the footfall in the ¡§people¡¦s palaces¡¨ that the Victorians created, and the thrills of the Moscow underground railway. ¡§You see these stations that are 80 years old, and they¡¦ve got stunning tiling. They¡¦ve got chandeliers! You think of the extra initial cost of those tiles, and light fittings. And then you say, every day, maybe 200,000 people see them. Times 365 times 80: that¡¦s value, the emotion that has given people.¡¨ He likes the idea that a properly developed society is where ¡§rich people all take public transport by choice¡¨.Over the years, like all successful showmen, Heatherwick has distilled his original thinking into a few parables. One of his favourites has been to ask an audience to consider a particular question of scale. Think of the intricacies and care that goes into making an earring, he says. And then think of an office block. ¡§Why do we spend so much more time making the one beautiful and not the other?¡¨ Every time he asks this, you are reminded that Heatherwick¡¦s mother, Stefany Tomalin (granddaughter of the owner of the fashion house Jaeger) is a jewellery designer who had a bead shop on the Portobello Road. And once you know that fact, it is hard not to imagine Heatherwick as a child, spending hours peering at that closeup world, wondering how he might better inhabit it.The imagining is the easy bit, he insists; the architecture bookshelves are full of brilliant ingenuities that never got made. The hard part is persuading the right people to buy into your vision. Heatherwick proved himself early on a great persuader; he would give out ice lollies at the end of any presentations he made that, once licked clean, would reveal his contact details on the stick. His collaborator on the Google HQ, the Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, has compared Heatherwick¡¦s skills in the boardroom to those of a hypnotist.His break came while he was at the Royal College of Art, studying furniture design. He buttonholed Sir Terence Conran on the stairs after a guest lecture, and persuaded the Habitat founder to allow him to build his graduate-thesis design at Conran¡¦s manor house in Berkshire. For some weeks, Heatherwick lived in Conran¡¦s home and made an 18ft-high gazebo out of strips of laminated birch. Conran, who became a friend and mentor, floated the idea that Heatherwick was ¡§the Leonardo da Vinci of our times¡¨, gave him some contacts, and advised him to set up his own studio, concentrating on a seductive space between design and architecture, making and mending.To begin with, his efforts to bring ¡§materiality and soulfulness¡¨ to the built environment were on a small scale. But with a series of quite mesmerising, discrete projects he established himself as the man most likely to perform those conjuring acts most desired by CEOs, pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box. There is a standing-ovation Ted Talk in which Heatherwick, mop-haired and self-effacing in a smock-like suit, explained to his audience the brilliant virtues of four of his studio¡¦s key projects: his bridge at Paddington Basin that curls back on itself like a geometric caterpillar; the separate petal-like torch-holders of the 2012 Olympic cauldron that rose in a magical uniting flame; his redesigned London Routemaster bus; and, above all, his remarkable UK Pavilion for Expo 2010, in Shanghai, a ¡§seed cathedral¡¨ formed from 60,000 fibre-optic rods that waved in the wind like a wheatfield. Noting that ¡§we expect buildings neither to be hairy nor in motion¡¨ Rowan Moore, the Observer¡¦s architecture critic, found the latter construction ¡§breathtaking¡¨.In the past decade, as a result of these singular calling cards, and somewhat to his surprise, Heatherwick¡¦s studio has been given multiple opportunities to answer his earring and tower block question for real; to move from the micro to the macro. His goal with all of these projects is sustainability, over a long time frame. ¡§You are generating carbon in the creation of any building,¡¨ he says. ¡§Don¡¦t add to that by making things that will need to be knocked down. We waste billions of tonnes of concrete and steel and glass by demolishing buildings that should never ever have been allowed to go up in the first place.¡¨Like all self-styled blue-sky thinkers, Heatherwick has experienced several thuds to earth. As he has discovered, politics and committees rarely intervene in the design of earrings; landmark city projects, more so. Cost ¡V which spiralled from a promised 60m to 200m or more ¡V finally killed the Garden Bridge; similar escalation eventually made a futuristic biomass power station in Teesside unworkable. Heatherwick¡¦s controversial Vessel structure in New York, his enormous jewel-like ¡§staircase to nowhere¡¨ at the centre of the 25bn Hudson Yards commercial redevelopment, did get built (and, at an eventual price of 200m, is arguably the most expensive sculpture ever made).Heatherwick was bruised in particular by the Garden Bridge. ¡§It wasn¡¦t my idea, but I thought it was a great idea,¡¨ he says. He made ¡§344 one-and-a-half-hour presentations¡¨, advocating for it. (¡§I believe Thomas has come straight from the woods,¡¨ Joanna Lumley, originator of the bridge idea, once suggested. ¡§He might be the Green Man. He has an extraordinary affinity with nature.¡¨)By the time the plug was finally pulled on the project by London mayor Sadiq Khan, the 60m pledged public funds had become a byword for his predecessor Boris Johnson¡¦s ego, profligacy and lack of transparency in procurement. As the Garden Bridge has come to be viewed as exhibit A in the arguments against Johnson¡¦s cronyism, has Heatherwick felt tarnished by association?¡§There¡¦s a cannibalistic side within the built-environment world that attacks anyone who is trying to do something in this space,¡¨ he says. ¡§Words like the one you used he doesn¡¦t want the expression ¡§cronyism¡¨ to pass his lips get thrown about. There are lots of talented designers and architects in Britain, who go all around the rest of the world doing projects. It¡¦s very normal in the world to speak to whoever is making the decisions, to lobby for things. But I think, here, lobbying has got a funny name.¡¨His most spectacular lobbying triumph was with Stephen Ross, 80, the billionaire property developer and the owner of the Miami Dolphins, who paid for Vessel. Tragically, the monstrous staircase structure, optimistically imagined as New York¡¦s Eiffel Tower, is currently closed after three people took their own lives by jumping from it in separate incidents. ¡§It¡¦s very, very sad and no one could have predicted what happened,¡¨ Heatherwick says. ¡§But we obviously absolutely supported closing the project down while we work out what changes can get made.¡¨If Heatherwick went into the pandemic with some of these clouds hanging over him, it seems likely that he will emerge from it with his reputation for innovation partly restored. Part of this has to do with a sort of undimmable idealism that he projects, and part with the fact that at least two of his most significant global projects seem to match exactly the demands of the post-pandemic moment.His Pier 55 development in New York, an undulating public park and amphitheatre set on bold pylons in the Hudson River, got mired in similar arguments to the Garden Bridge and ground to a halt. ¡§But then the mayor of New York and the authorities got together and realised they were going to lose this whole philanthropic project,¡¨ Heatherwick says (the bulk of it was funded by new media billionaire Barry Diller and his wife, designer Diane von F?rstenberg.) The opening of what is now known as Little Island will coincide with the liberation from lockdown, allowing people to safely gather outdoors.Meanwhile, his 1,000 Trees development in Shanghai, a high-rise garden village built like a rolling hillside and 10 years in the making, is also nearing completion. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon theme emphasises Heatherwick¡¦s insistence that in a lower pollution, electric-car future, ¡§outdoors must once again be a place.¡¨ Landscaping, he says, ¡§can no longer be treated as garnish, like a sprig of parsley in a serving suggestion¡¨. The ventilation requirements of the pandemic have made people realise, he says, ¡§the insane degree to which air conditioning has been taken up in the UK ¡V where most months of the year it¡¦s fine to have windows that open; instead, we seal ourselves in.¡¨ (Heatherwick¡¦s Routemaster bus was widely criticised for its lack of upper-deck ventilation ¡V in fact the opening windows in the original design had been vetoed by Transport for London. It took him six years to win the argument to get them retrofitted.)The best recent example of his fresh-air thinking is his contribution to the Maggie¡¦s Centre project, hidden under plants and trees within the campus of St James¡¦s University Hospital in Leeds. The spruce timber and lime plaster construction is a support centre for cancer patients, part of the legacy of Maggie Keswick Jencks. As well as a place where they can access advice and therapy, patients and visitors ¡§are encouraged to participate in the care of the 23,000 bulbs and 17,000 plants on site¡¨. The building, set among the impersonal towering blocks of a modern hospital, makes the argument, Heatherwick says, ¡§that hospital architecture should be about wellness¡¨ as a counterpoint to that sense of a ¡§sickness factory, where even children smell fear in the space when they walk in¡¨. He hopes that other similarly ambitious healthcare proposals will find the light of day.I wonder, if he were put in charge of ¡§building back better¡¨ after the pandemic, what else would be top of his list of principles.He suggests first we need to be more humble about learning from the past. ¡§Whenever you go to a new city, and someone says, ¡¥Well, where would you like to go?¡¦ you¡¦re very unlikely to say, ¡¥I¡¦ll go to the new office district,¡¦¡¨ he says. ¡§You go to the old parts of town that have not been destroyed.City planners, he suggests, spend too much time talking about how high buildings are and what the tops of them will look like, ¡§when nearly everyone¡¦s experience of those buildings will be the 8m from pavement level¡¨. He has been strongly influenced by Jane Jacobs, pioneering author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities, who campaigned for variety and human scale at street level. Walking the empty city, Heatherwick says, everyone feels her conclusions instinctively. ¡§The more doors you can see, the more alive a place is. The fewer doors, the more scary or alienating it is.¡¨ We have had enough of ¡§wide faceless blocks with boring glass lobbies, and pointless artworks above reception as a gesture towards culture¡¨.He finds himself looking more and more at how the Victorians and the Georgians built, in order to replicate not the style, but the understanding of density. ¡§I can understand the thrill of wanting to ¡¥reinvent the idea of the street¡¦ after the war,¡¨ he says. ¡§But we have to acknowledge that failed.¡¨ Some cities, Madrid for example, have been using the lockdown to address that fact, he believes, reclaiming public spaces with pedestrianisation. In London and the UK he doesn¡¦t yet sense that ¡§wholeheartedness¡¨ in response to the pandemic. Not enough people, he says, ¡§are really thinking of how to cherish the city as a new kind of space, as a room, as a meaningful gathering place ¡V but that is going to be needed to bring people back.¡¨ ',\n",

It¡¦s true Daumier was a brilliant satirist, the French Gillray, whose lethal graphic art made real political impact (he famously portrayed King Louis Philippe as a pear, a grotesquerie that stuck). But as his contemporary the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire recognised, he was also a pure artist poised powerfully between romanticism and realism, tragedy and comedy. We see that profound side here.',\n",
              " 'At the end of last month, planning permission was finally granted for the building of Britain¡¦s most significant memorial to the Holocaust, just a few days after the death, at the age of 49 from cancer, of Asa Bruno, a director of the practice that designed its distinctive fin-based structure.In the four years since Ron Arad Architects won the competition to design the 100m project on London¡¦s Victoria Gardens, in partnership with David Adjaye Associates and the landscape architects Gustafson Porter + Bowman, nobody did more than Bruno to make the project possible.It was Bruno who steered the project through a long, drawn-out consultation process, an increasingly negative campaign against it and, finally, cross-examination in a gruelling public inquiry. He dealt elegantly and eloquently with everything from inaccurate claims that the memorial neglected Roma and gay victims of the Nazis, to suggestions that a park in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament was the wrong site.Against a background of so many misfiring and banal memorials, the project, which blends architecture, sculpture and landscape, is an assertion of the residual potential of a monument to make a powerful and authentic emotional statement. Bruno quietly rebuked those who believed, for whatever reason, that Britain had no need of such a reminder of the unspeakable evils of which the world is capable.Born in Jerusalem, Asa was the son of Ofra (nee Hirschenberg), an art therapist, and Michael Bruno, an economist who became the governor of the Bank of Israel, and later chief economist at the World Bank. His brother, Ido, is the director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. If Asa had stayed, he would have been at the heart of the country¡¦s establishment.But he was determined to be an architect, and in 1993, after high school, he left to study at the Architectural Association in London, where he believed he could be at the centre of the international architectural debate.Graduating in 1998, he initially joined Jonathan Caplan Architecture. In 2000, Arad told a friend: ¡§I am looking for an architect who is very tall, has a loud voice, plays the piano and ping pong, knows all about computers but can also draw with a pencil, and is good with people.¡¨ Bruno fitted the part exactly.The first major project that Bruno worked on with Arad was the Design Museum in Holon, a small city in the shadow of Tel Aviv, with an ambitious mayor determined to use architecture to make a mark. Fabricated from coils of Corten steel, which wrap a highly organised sequence of galleries inside a dynamic sculptural composition, it opened in 2010, and convincingly proved that Arad¡¦s approach was applicable to architecture as well as art and design.¡§He had his own way of appropriating a project, but he looked after me,¡¨ Arad said. ¡§Normally building is a journey of compromises. But thanks to Asa, there was no difference between the sketches and Holon as a finished building.¡¨Bruno was a charismatic figure, the horse whisperer who steered Arad, an artist who, though he trained as an architect, has an international reputation as an uncompromising and highly original designer, through the frustrations and difficulties of architectural practice, to give him the chance to build architecture on a substantial scale.¡§He was the responsible grown-up in the office,¡¨ said Arad. ¡§We had a special way of working together, we would sit and talk, and he would understand everything. I am a reluctant member of the architectural world. He was in the RIBA. I never wear a tie, he never minded the dress code. I told him his biggest problem is that he is good at everything.¡¨Bruno became a director of the practice in 2007, and worked with Arad on a wide range of projects around the world, from the refurbishment of the Watergate building in Washington to an award-winning and unconventional pair of skyscrapers, the taller of which is now rising in Tel Aviv and will be 80 floors high, by way of projects for Maserati in Modena, Yohji Yamamoto in Tokyo, the M?diacit? retail centre in Li?ge, Belgium, and a cancer care wing at a hospital in Israel.There was also a tantalising string of might-have-been projects ¡V a restaurant balanced on a mountaintop fulcrum in Gstaad, Switzerland, for Bernie Ecclestone, a remarkable villa in Marrakech using local skills and materials to create a radical approach to climate and space, and an alchemical transformation of what was once the boiler house of Battersea power station into Upper World, a luxury hotel and private dining room reached by a lift inside the chimney stacks.Bruno led the architecture studio in Camden, north London, transforming Arad¡¦s boldly drawn sketches that initially seemed beyond the bounds of the achievable into physical reality. He was a passionate believer in architecture as a creative cultural form, but knew that to build, tact, diplomacy and clarity were essential.He described the process of developing the proposal for the memorial ¡§as a sensitive balancing act between creating an emotive experience, befitting the weight of the subject matter, and a careful physical integration into Victoria Tower gardens. The memorial aims to strike the right balance between significance and peaceful coexistence within its rich context and the crucial juxtaposition of the Houses of Parliament as its backdrop.¡¨Announcing the government¡¦s decision to start work on building before the end of the year, Lord (Eric) Pickles, co-chair of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, paid tribute to Bruno¡¦s contribution, saying: ¡§Asa had so much to give, his patience and calmness at the planning inquiry did us all a great service.¡¨Bruno is survived by his wife, Tamara Bloch, a fashion designer whom he married in 2001, their two sons, Benjamin and Emmanuel, his siblings, Yael and Ido, and his mother, Ofra. Asa Bruno, architect, born 12 December 1971; died 20 July 2021',\n",
              " 'When Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World in 1932, he portrayed a society in which the importance of discarding old clothes was whispered into the ears of sleeping children (¡§Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches¡¨) ¡V so vital was the imperative to drive consumption of the new. He set his novel 600 years into the future, but later suggested that its ¡§horror may be upon us within a single century¡¨. He wasn¡¦t far off.Product life spans are getting shorter ¡V one UK-based fashion company advises buyers to work to quality standards that assume a dress will stay in its owner¡¦s wardrobe for less than five weeks. And it¡¦s not just clothes: household appliances can be cheaper to replace than repair, with spare parts often available only if harvested from retired machines. Something as simple as a depleted battery frequently spells the end for today¡¦s hermetically sealed electronic devices, and even attempting a repair can render warranties invalid.But a new law ¡V the ¡§right to repair bill¡¨ ¡V has just come into force, aiming to end the ¡§built to break¡¨ cycle by requiring that manufactures make spare parts and maintenance information available for their products. The intention is to overcome built-in obsolescence, enable repairs and extend lifespans. The government now expects white goods to last for up to a decade, rather than the seven-year average reported by the Whitegoods Trade Association.But campaigners, such as the co-founder of the Restart Project, Janet Gunter, argue that the measures don¡¦t go far enough. ¡§This has been widely reported as ¡¥problem solved¡¦, but the rules only apply to lighting, washing machines, dishwashers and fridges ¡V and they only give spare parts and repair documentation to professionals,¡¨ she says. ¡§We want to see ecodesign legislation applied to other hard-to-repair tech products and offer the right to repair to everyone.¡¨Today, artists and designers are leading the way in exploring what mending really means. They might not be offering to fix your broken toaster, but through exploring the practice of repair, they are laying the groundwork for new ways of thinking about the objects we surround ourselves with. Perhaps we can move away from the veneration of newness that is exemplified by unboxing videos on YouTube, and instead learn to celebrate the storied patina that comes with care and repair.Mending is a metaphor for Aya Haidar. Her Recollections series comprises photographs of war-damaged buildings in Beirut into which she stitches multicoloured embroidery thread to ¡§repair¡¨ the bullet holes. ¡§It was about filling in these voids ¡V these holes that are scars, remnants and traces of something that is dark, ugly and traumatising, and filling it with something colourful and joyful,¡¨ she says.Her Lebanese family fled the war in 1982, moving first to Saudi Arabia and then London. ¡§For my family, those damaged buildings remind them of something terrifying, but something that does need to be remembered.¡¨By embellishing and filling the cracks with beautiful, colourful threads, she emphasises them, so the war that caused them is not forgotten. Haidar¡¦s work focuses on found and recycled objects and explores themes such as loss, migration and memory. In the Soleless Series, she embroidered images of migrants¡¦ journeys on to the soles of their worn-out shoes. ¡§The shoes physically carried refugees across borders and across lands,¡¨ she says. ¡§They were so worn and torn that they were not fit for purpose, but instead of throwing them away, I embroidered images of their journeys on to their soles, adding another layer of meaning. I couldn¡¦t return the function to those shoes, but I could tell their story and show their value.¡¨Haidar runs youth workshops for refugees and uses craft as a way to help them process traumatic experiences. ¡§The physical act of mending works towards an emotional repair,¡¨ she says. ¡§Because craft is slow, considered, repetitive and thoughtful, the women who take part in my workshops are left with their own thoughts and the time to process them in the flow of making. It is a solitary process, but also a collective experience. The conversations that come out of the workshops are very real, very honest, very raw. There is a beautiful sense of healing that starts to happen.¡¨For Jay Blades, presenter of the BBC¡¦s Repair Shop, mending is about community. Described by the BBC as ¡§a heartwarming antidote to throwaway culture¡¨, the programme sees members of the public bring broken objects to a barn in the grounds of the Weald and Downland Living Museum, get them fixed, and take them away again.¡§On paper, it doesn¡¦t sound that interesting,¡¨ laughs Blades. Yet 7 million people tune in to every episode. The secret of its unlikely success is perhaps found in its origin story. Katy Thorogood, creative director of production company Ricochet, took a chair that had belonged to her late mother to be reupholstered. When the upholsterer handed her a framed sample of the original fabric as a keepsake, she simultaneously burst into tears and had the idea for her next TV show.¡§The upholsterer didn¡¦t need to do that, but he did it simply because it was a kind thing to do,¡¨ says Blades. ¡§What makes The Repair Shop so special is its community ¡V its love. It¡¦s about doing something kind for someone that you don¡¦t know.¡¨That¡¦s a theme that runs through Blades¡¦s own story. He established Out of the Dark with his then-wife, Jade, in High Wycombe in 2000 to enable disadvantaged young people to learn practical skills from the last generation of furniture makers in the area. ¡§It was about turning furniture that someone had written off into something desirable and explaining to young people the connection between that and giving them the skills they needed to go into a job interview with their heads held high.¡¨When that project came to an end due to the perfect storm of cashflow problems and the end of his marriage, it was again the community that stepped in. He had been living in his car for a week when a friend offered him a job and a place to stay ¡V and he¡¦s been living with that friend¡¦s family ever since. Having got back on his feet, he was already running Jay & Co, his own furniture-restoration business, when the BBC came calling. ¡§Of course, The Repair Shop is a celebration of craft skills, but at its heart, it¡¦s about caring for people by repairing the things that matter to them,¡¨ says Blades.For Chris Miller, restoration is a direct response to the climate crisis. Skinflint, the vintage lighting website he co-founded, specialises in sourcing lighting from the 1920s to the 1970s, usually from hospitals, churches or factories. The company has saved 50,000 lights from landfill, making them safe and functional and then giving them what Miller calls a ¡§light touch¡¨ restoration, maintaining the patina of their age.The decision to source mainly industrial lights is about availability and volume, and his chosen era is bookended by the advent of mainstream electric lighting in the 1920s and the introduction of plastics in the 1970s.¡§Churches were the first to be electrified and we still salvage 1920s church lights, because they have had quite an easy life ¡V they¡¦re only used once a week and they tend to be quite high up,¡¨ he explains. ¡§After the 1970s, you start to see planned obsolescence and failure engineering, and the effects of engineers handling a material they didn¡¦t fully understand.¡¨So far, so pragmatic, but it was actually a tragic personal experience that motivated the decision to set up an environmentally driven business. Miller was in Sri Lanka when the tsunami hit the country on 26 December 2004. ¡§Ordinarily, we make travel up as we go along, but on this occasion, we had booked various places in advance ¡V and that¡¦s what saved our lives,¡¨ he says. On 24 December, he and his wife reluctantly left the waterside hut they¡¦d been staying in and moved inland to a pre-booked jungle lodge for Christmas Day. Just 48 hours later, the tsunami destroyed those waterside huts, taking the lives of many of the people they¡¦d been with just days before. It was a wake-up call.¡§We all experience signpost moments,¡¨ he says. ¡§Most we miss, some we see but don¡¦t act upon, and some just hit us smack in the face. We left our jobs in London and moved to Cornwall with a three-month-old baby. Skinflint was launched two years later.¡¨For Miller, ¡§the key driver for our business is the environment ¡V we can¡¦t go on the way we have for the last 100 years. The resources are just not there.¡¨Former artist-in-residence at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Bridget Harvey might actually offer to fix your toaster ¡V alongside her artistic practice, she is the co-organiser of Hackney Fixers, a community group modelled on the Dutch Repair Caf? initiative that pairs the owners of broken things with volunteers who can mend them. But her work as an artist is concerned with what we make, how we make it, and why that matters.¡§What I¡¦m interested in is how we move through the world, how we interact with objects, and whether their repair is embraced, rejected, or something in between ¡V it is all a really interesting window into how we think, how society operates and how objects define us.¡¨Her work spans clothing, ceramics, and objects that embrace both. Blue Jumper 2012¡V2019 is about to join V&A¡¦s permanent collection as part of their fashion galleries curated around garment lifecycles, but it began life as a second-hand woollen jumper in Harvey¡¦s own wardrobe. When it got damaged by moths, she carried on wearing it, darning the holes in contrasting colours. When moths got it again, she simply kept darning it, and kept wearing it, describing herself as the ¡§disobedient owner of a disobedient garment¡¨.Her Mend More jumper is a more direct statement ¡V made as a placard for a climate march, the navy-blue sweater is emblazoned with the words ¡§Mend More Bin Less¡¨ on one side and ¡§Mend More Buy Less¡¨ on the other, which she appliqu?d on, making each letter from left over yellow fabric scraps.Kintsuglue Plate 2019 is a commentary on the increasing popularity of the deliberately visible Japanese repair technique, kintsugi. Instead of using the traditional urushi lacquer and gold powder, she has used a Kintsuglue ¡V a copycat product emulating Sugru, a mouldable ¡§glue¡¨ that can be manipulated like Plasticine for 30 minutes until it sets. With these layers of influences, and not having designed or fabricated the plate nor the Kintsuglue herself, Harvey is exploring notions of authorship within repaired objects. In other pieces, she has patched a blanket with tin cans, and bridged the gap between two halves of a broken bowl with a beadwork section, rendering it repaired but useless. She is playing at the fringes of repair, asking us to question when something is truly broken and when it is really mended.Singapore-based designer, educator and curator Hans Tan wants to champion the role of repair in contemporary design. ¡§In most Asian cultures, mending is seen as something you do only when you can¡¦t afford to replace something,¡¨ he says. ¡§Buying new is important as a symbol of prosperity ¡V and mending is not seen as a profession. I want to reposition repair as an aspirational activity that can generate inspirational outcomes.¡¨He has started to do that through R is for Repair, an exhibition at the National Design Centre, Singapore, earlier this year. Commissioned by DesignSingapore Council, the exhibition proposed that one way to reduce the 0.74 kg of waste the World Bank estimates we each generate every day, is through extending the lives of objects we might otherwise throw away. Tan invited 10 members of the public to submit broken objects and paired them with 10 contemporary designers. Tan gave Tiffany Loy ¡V a Singaporean artist trained in industrial design and textile-weaving ¡V a Calvin Klein tote bag that Arnold Goh bought with his first pay cheque. Once his pride and joy, it had developed holes and been relegated to use as a grocery bag. Loy flipped the bag inside out, taking advantage of the undamaged lining, and added a cord mesh ¡V both to strengthen it and to form a handy external pocket.Hunn Wai and Francesca Lanzavecchia, co-founders of Lanzavecchia + Wai, were given a 15 watch with a broken strap that held sentimental value for its owner. ¡§We are both quite romantic designers ¡V we seek to re-humanise situations and objects and bring about new behaviours, so we were really happy to be given a timepiece to work on,¡¨ says Wai. ¡§A watch is a powerful object ¡V it has a lot of narratives and unwittingly becomes part of your identity over a period of time. Even though this was a cheap watch, it was well made and still working.¡¨They encased the mass-produced timepiece in a bespoke walnut case with brass fixings aligned to the quarter-hour, turning it into a precious clock. ¡§Commonly, we perceive sustainable practice as something that comes with inconvenience, cost or sacrifice,¡¨ says Tan. ¡§But sustainability can be articulated and practised in an attractive, purposeful way ¡V and as designers we are uniquely placed to reposition repair as aspirational.

              " 'Amsterdam¡¦s Rijksmuseum has announced a ¡§first and last¡¨ exhibition of all the paintings by Johannes Vermeer that are fit to travel, as its director claimed growing museum rivalry makes such international cooperation unlikely in the future.Vermeer, whose most famous work is Girl with a Pearl Earring, dating from around 1665, is thought to have painted 35 masterpieces, of which 23 were shown together 26 years ago at the Mauritshuis in The Hague.Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum director, said his institution would surpass that number but he did not expect such a collection to ever be possible again owing to the age of the works and the intense competition among galleries to draw in visitors.¡§What I am seeing, if you look since the 1996 exhibition, it is more and more difficult to get the loans because Vermeer is such an iconic painter,¡¨ he said. ¡§For museums to part with Vermeer¡¦s work is more and more difficult. Because it is the first for the Rijksmuseum, it has created a kind of feeling that we have to do it now as it gives an opportunity to compare and study the works together.¡§The pressure on museums to make exhibitions is larger. There are more and more museums in the world and works from the 17th century are fragile. There is more pressure on the works.¡¨Vermeer, who lived and worked in Delft in the west of the Netherlands, is widely regarded to stand with Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Picasso as one of the finest artists in history, but relatively little is known about him or the subjects of his paintings. He was barely known as an artist when he died at 43 in 1675.The latest technology in the study of art has recently revealed the strenuous preparation and effort he made with his paintings, and the expensive pigments that were used, explaining his relatively small oeuvre of works.From 10 February 2023 to 4 June 2023 the Rijksmuseum will exhibit masterpieces such as Girl with a Pearl Earring, loaned from the Mauritshuis; The Geographer, from the St?del Museum in Frankfurt; Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid, from the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin; and Woman Holding a Balance, from the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.The newly restored Girl Reading a Letter at the Open Window, from the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden, will be seen for the first time in the Netherlands. Dibbits said negotiations were ongoing with museums to try to get the maximum number of works.¡§I think that will be impossible to have them all, but we are getting lots, more than I ever dreamed to have,¡¨ he said. ¡§Some works are very fragile.¡¨Dibbits said gathering the paintings together would offer an opportunity to ¡§an entirely new generation of researchers and public who have never been able to study Vermeer in such a way¡¨.He said: ¡§It is incredibly hard for researchers when you move between museums to look at paintings, your brain has done a lot of tricks, it is very difficult to actually compare.¡¨The Rijksmuseum has four masterpieces by Vermeer, including The Milkmaid and The Little Street.Martine Gosselink, the director of the Mauritshuis, said: ¡§The Girl with the Pearl Earring is the most famous Dutch girl in the world. Yes, we will miss her terribly, but a Vermeer exhibition without the Girl is simply not a Vermeer exhibition.¡¨',\n",
              " 'It is hard to pin down exactly what Lord Whitney does. On paper, the Leeds-based artist studio has built music video sets for Nicki Minaj, art-directed promo footage for The Voice, built a fantastical world for Chambord liqueur, recreated scenery from hit Netflix shows and transformed the underbelly of Leeds Town Hall into a forest. Its founders, Amy Lord and Rebekah Whitney, refer to themselves as ¡§connoisseurs of make-believe¡¨, but this title is as evasive as our rambling Zoom conversation, during which they discuss reading children¡¦s books, choosing the perfect pitch for a piece of music and playing with ice skates in a stately home.Until you step into one of the magical worlds they have conceived and constructed, perhaps it¡¦s hard to make sense of what they do. But inch a toe under the dusty half-light of an old gardener¡¦s office at Harewood House, touch the fading documentation peeling off crypt walls under Leeds city centre and breathe in the cherry blossom fragrance wafting through the Great Hall of Chatsworth, and the wonder of what Lord Whitney creates is immediately apparent. Even their studio, a renovated mill in the Meanwood area of Leeds, is a playground featuring a treehouse, an indoor greenhouse and a cabinet of curiosities.¡§It really does have quite a profound effect,¡¨ says Whitney of being in their immersive worlds. ¡§Even though I understand it all and my head is in it to the tiniest detail, I find it incredibly moving, being in something that takes on all of your senses.¡¨She is referring specifically to their latest commission, Upon a Christmas Wish at Harewood House in West Yorkshire. The combination of a Christmas brief and an 18th-century stately home does not initially sound very original but Lord Whitney has avoided the traditional focus on festive aesthetics by collaborating with poet Toby Thompson and sound designers Buffalo to drop audiences into an imaginarium of cine footage, fascinating artefacts and whispering walls.Despite this, they are adamant it is true to the Lascelles family property. ¡§It is really rooted in the building, you couldn¡¦t put it on anywhere else,¡¨ explains Lord. ¡§We started looking for a seed of a story in Harewood¡¦s history. Once we started digging through the archive, we found all these little bits of history, and then we started tying that in with all our own references.¡¨After 13 years working together and with a pandemic (hopefully) behind them, the pair are more certain than ever of the value of their work. Built into the heart of their make-believe worlds is a desire to quell anxiety and stop us in our tracks, inviting us to put down our phones, forget about the shopping list and simply experience the space embracing us. ¡§I personally find sitting down and doing mindfulness really hard,¡¨ says Whitney. ¡§I am not very good at meditating; my brain is too busy. In entering immersive experiences ¡V not just ours, immersive experiences in general ¡V it allows your brain to switch off for a while. I think that pause is so, so valuable.¡¨Valuable for what? ¡§Mental health,¡¨ says Lord. ¡§People forget that as much as going to the gym and eating healthy food is important, allowing your mind time to drift and play can be healing as well. I think there are so few opportunities in life to do that. We are used to sitting in front of the TV or maybe going to the theatre, but what we want to do is to take it to the level where you are stepping into a whole other world, so you really come out of it feeling like you¡¦ve been on a journey.¡¨Whitney then delves into the empowering possibilities of viewing the world with both logic and innocence, and talks about William Blake¡¦s ¡§mythic consciousness¡¨. Later Lord emails me a quote about it, which originated from a project exploring folklore and traditions in the north of England. This is how Lord Whitney work. Or rather, this is how Amy and Rebekah work: together, pulling strands out of the imagined, unseen world and into the daylight. Their method of collaboration is as vital as their ability to wield a glue gun or a roll of gaffer tape. Throughout our conversation they continually refer back to each other, detailing how they overcame Lord¡¦s lockdown creativity drought and Whitney¡¦s post maternity leave impostor syndrome by hopping on Zoom and talking, talking and talking until the new ideas came spilling out.¡§I don¡¦t think I realised how much I needed Lord Whitney. It is not just a job it is such a huge part of me,¡¨ says Whitney. Bathed under the twinkling lights and dancing shadows of Harewood house, it is easy to see why we might all need a bit of Lord Whitney too.',\n",
              " 'You are walking up a staircase that winds up to the top of a tall square tower. It ascends one side, then the next, then the next ¡V and then suddenly you are right back where you started. This is the kind of problem people who are trapped in the geometrically impossible, yet still strangely plausible, worlds of MC Escher have to deal with all the time. In his mind-boggling creations, dimensions collide and normality dissolves. Looking into his pictures is like standing on the very edge of a cliff ¡V and being right down at the bottom at the same time.The Dutchman¡¦s illusions have been famous and beloved since the 1950s, when spaced-out fans first started claiming to see hemp plants hidden in his art. And now we have Kaleidocycles, a Taschen book about the artist featuring paper puzzle kits that allow you to actually build his paradoxical structures at home, unlikely as that may seem. The tome has just been reissued in time for Christmas and the 50th anniversary of his death next year. His work does seem perfect for the festive season, given it¡¦s all fun and games. Or at least that¡¦s how it seems, initially.Escher¡¦s visionary flair did not just confine itself to art: he also intruded into the world of science. His profound yet impossible perspectives seem to prophesy the greatest tricks of virtual reality. Yet Maurits Cornelis Escher ¡V born in Leeuwarden, a city north of Amsterdam, in 1898 ¡V showed absolutely no aptitude for any academic subject at school. His father was a hydraulic engineer ¡V an important job in a country with so much land reclaimed from the sea. Although he despaired of his son, he supported young Maurits in his studies at art college in Haarlem, and in his travels around southern Europe, where he spent years developing his style.In the 1920s, Piet Mondrian and the De Stijl movement were taking Dutch art into pure abstraction. Escher, meanwhile, was in Italy ¡V using traditional printmaking skills to depict timeless cities on picturesque hilltops. These designs would become the building blocks of his deceiving universe. A thickly inked engraving of St Peter¡¦s that he made in 1935 takes a spectacular, god¡¦s-eye view of the Vatican basilica¡¦s vast interior from up inside the dome. We see tiny people on the floor far below, as columns plummet down towards them in rushing, scary perspective.In this powerful engraving, you can clearly see the roots of Escher¡¦s art. The work reveals his love of perspective, the method of depicting deep space and distance invented in Renaissance Italy. To the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, perspective was not just art but science. He filled his notebooks with sketches of buildings and landscapes, fascinated by this mathematical technique.Earlier this year, a film called Escher: Journey into Infinity looked afresh at this artist, examining how he gained cult status in the US counterculture, with bootleg versions of his work appearing on T-shirts. As well as exploring his influences, which range from densely packed Italian hilltop towns to the music of Bach, we found out that Mick Jagger once wrote to Escher, asking him to create an album cover. Not only did the artist decline, he told the Rolling Stone off for addressing him by his first name.A flat surface is just a flat surface. As soon as you depict something on it that seems to have depth and solidity, you are constructing an illusion. In Escher¡¦s most mature and unsettling works, he takes that to extremes to orchestrate multi-dimensional crashes of alternate realities. In his 1953 picture Relativity, everything is drawn in strict perspective. The only trouble is there are three points of view looking towards three vanishing points (the point where lines that would be parallel in reality meet on the page). The artist called these ¡§different worlds¡¨ and in one of them, a waiter walks down an upside-down staircase to serve al fresco diners, whose table is vertical. In another, lovers stroll in a garden in defiance of gravity. Only a flight of stairs that rises from the bottom of the picture is ¡§the right way up¡¨. Yet rotate the square image on its side and everything changes. A different world now becomes the real one.Escher¡¦s dive into the beauty of maths and science started when his eyes were opened by an art even older than that of the Renaissance. When he visited the Alhambra, the medieval Islamic palace that sprawls along a clifftop overlooking Granada in southern Spain, he was carried away on a magic carpet of inspiration. Its rooms were lined with brightly coloured tiles arranged in complex patterns, fitted together in lattices of mind-boggling symmetry, all inspired by Arab science. Mathematics calls this tessellation: the complete covering of a surface by interlocking shapes without any gaps. It is the glory of Andalusian Islamic art.Escher was transfixed. He also felt challenged ¡V as if he was looking on the work of rivals. He started drawing his own tessellated surfaces, but with a difference. While the Alhambra is full of abstract shapes, Escher set out to tessellate figurative images. Birds, fish, lizards, angels, devils ¡V he fits together these repeated forms in hallucinatory flows that transform from one thing into another. Fish swim with wide open mouths under the sea while birds glide above: then you see the gaps between the birds are fish shaped, and vice versa. They meet at the sea¡¦s surface in a dazzling metamorphosis.Europe was heading into shadow as Escher saw the artistic light. Horrified at the thought of his sons being brought up under fascist ideology, he moved his family from Italy to Switzerland. They then moved to Belgium but, after his mother died and the country was seized by the Nazis, they returned to the Netherlands to be closer to family and to settle her inheritance. Escher despised the Nazis and refused to ever visit Germany.So it is surely not a coincidence that he started revealing gaps in reality the very moment the world was being sucked into a black hole. In his 1938 print Day and Night, two flights of swans, black and white, tessellate as they fly in opposite directions across the border between day and night. Look longer and you realise the nocturnal and daylit landscapes are mirror images of the same European vista. Escher depicts an eerie symmetry between light and dark in the year of the Munich agreement, with the continent on a knife edge between war and peace.In 1944, now back home in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, it would fall to Escher to get into the home of his beloved Jewish art teacher Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita ¡V to save as much art as he could. ¡§The Mesquita family,¡¨ he would later write, ¡§had been hauled out of bed and taken away. It must now be regarded as practically certain that S Jessurun de Mesquita, his wife and their son Jaap all perished in a German camp.¡¨Escher¡¦s fantastic tessellations brought the maths of the Alhambra head to head with modern physics. Roger Penrose, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on black holes, encountered Escher¡¦s art in the 1950s while at a conference in Amsterdam. He went home and tried drawing Escher-like conundrums, publishing a paper that unveiled two ¡§impossible¡¨ objects: a staircase that loops on itself without going up, and a solid triangular structure that looks real yet is connected in a totally absurd way, with its three corners all seeming to push outward while actually being on the same plane.When Escher saw these Escheresque objects, he responded with his own fantastic interpretations of the infinite staircase and the Penrose triangle. His 1960 print Ascending and Descending depicts cowled figures marching up and down a staircase atop a palace that just takes them back to where they started. In 1961¡¦s Waterfall, he gives the same seductive depth and detail to a vision of a waterfall working a mill. After hitting the mill wheel, water flows along a flat, zig-zagging channel until ¡V impossibly ¡V it falls again. Escher explained it was based on the Penrose triangle. So, in the 1960s, this Dutch graphic artist who had failed at school was in dialogue with the most advanced mathematics around.Another print shows angels and devils interlocking on a sphere-like surface, getting smaller as they approach the edges of the globe. While striking, it looks almost straightforwardly Escheresque ¡V yet in his book Cycles of Time, Penrose uses this work to explain the non-Euclidean ¡§hyperbolic¡¨ geometry behind a new theory of the cosmos. In the pantheon of art-and-science crossovers, this is an extraordinary achievement.Art is another way of thinking about the universe. It can illustrate mathematical phenomena that few could follow any other way. Escher took two artistic traditions, Islamic abstraction and Renaissance perspective, and fused them. The result is a multiverse of delights with no correct way up or down. Escher proved that looking can be a magical kind of thinking.',\n",
              " 'Your typical new block of flats is something like this: corridors and lobbies, often windowless, lead to flats where everything is the minimum required by regulations. There is little wit or thought in the layout or pleasure in individual spaces ¡V just the pursuit of the shortest route to squeezing in the maximum possible accommodation ¡V nor in the stuff of which the building is made. The external walls, whether finished in skinny brickwork or some other cladding material, have a just-stuck-together feeling. There is no sense of substance, just an expedient assemblage of building products, which, if you tap them, will probably sound dull and hollow. You have to trust that these outcomes of opaque technical and regulatory procedures won¡¦t burn or leak or fall off, but you have no particular reason to do so.A House for Artists in Barking, east London, designed by the young architectural practice Apparata, sets out to be the opposite. The journey from street to home is by external stairs and balconies that give you fresh air and views and a sense of space and of connection to the neighbourhood. There is enough space for residents to inhabit balconies with plants and personal objects while still leaving room for circulation. Ceilings are high and the walls to the apartments are mostly glass, which allows light to flood in. Large windows and doors can be folded open in good weather, such that inside and outside spaces flow into each other.There are no lobbies or corridors inside the block¡¦s 12 flats, most of them two-bedroomed, which increases their sense of space. There is some flexibility in their layout, with the possibility of relocating the kitchen and adding or removing a bedroom to accommodate children arriving or growing or moving out, or an elderly relative coming to live. The idea, says Astrid Smitham of Apparata, is to reflect ¡§the diverse configuration of people¡¦s lives today¡¨. Little is wasted. If something is needed for functional reasons, such as a route for escaping from fire, it is also taken as an opportunity for enjoyment.The structure is solid concrete, whose slightly shiny coating stops it streaking in the rain, and whose cement content is reduced with the help of alternative materials, so as to minimise its carbon footprint. It is reassuringly substantial. You can see and feel the weight of the building. The ceilings of the flats are in exposed concrete, too, which helps you know that you are in something built by human beings, out of materials that have a physical presence.This unusual block of flats comes from unusual origins. It is, as the name suggests, for artists, the result of a six-year effort by the arts organisation Create London to provide affordable rented housing, at 65% of the market rate, for creative people. It has been realised in collaboration with the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. Grayson Perry lent his support, as an ¡§advocate and sounding board¡¨.The aim of the project is not only to provide affordable housing for cash-strapped creatives ¡V whose skills run from printmaking to photography to video art ¡V but also to contribute something to the neighbourhood, to harness a little of artists¡¦ well-known ability to bring a bit of life to a place. The ground floor is a glass-walled community space, where artists can make and exhibit their work, or hold adult education classes or parties or indeed anything that might contribute to the life of the area. (The well-lit flats are also good places to work, but tenants don¡¦t get individual studio spaces.)Nor are the flats conceived only as isolated residential units, but also as parts of the community of the whole block. Residents will be encouraged to take responsibility for its management. On one floor there are double doors in the party walls between flats, soundproofed when closed, which can be opened up to join living rooms into one big collective space. The arrangement of the block, with three flats on each of the four floors above ground level, reached by those shared balconies, encourages communication between the flats.A House for Artists is a work of simple pleasures and straightforward good things. Its design is based on a smart interpretation of the regulations concerning escape from fire; by providing external balconies on both sides of the block, it does away with the need for internal corridors.It also has architectural intelligence. There¡¦s thought in the placing of the joints in the concrete, such that they help create an illusion that the building is made of large masonry blocks, which reinforces the impression of strength. It looks a thing of pillars and beams ¡V basic elements of architecture at least since ancient Egypt. But then, just when it might become too serious for its own good, it lightens the mood with circles and triangles cut into the walls as if it were a child¡¦s toy, with further triangular shapes on the roofline.It manages to speak to the disparate elements of the William Street Quarter, a recent regeneration project that stands next door. This is a bizarre combination of big glum grey blocks, uncannily like the least charming estates of the 1960s, and rows of little pitched-roofed brick houses. A House for Artists, with its triangles and oblongs and its middle-sized scale, has something of both, while being more appealing than either.It¡¦s a perky and punchy building, at once big and small and grand and intimate. It is robust rather than exquisite, severe more than cosy, but still a place to call home. Create London see it as a prototype: now that they have their Barking example they want to pitch the idea elsewhere. Here¡¦s hoping that more like this are built, and not only for creatives. All new housing has something to learn from A House for Artists.',\n",
              " 'Chris Wilkinson, who has died aged 76, was the co-founder of the architecture practice that most defined the technocratic optimism of the millennium projects era. WilkinsonEyre were the first architects to win the RIBA Stirling prize two years running, for their Magna science centre in Rotherham in 2001 and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge in 2002, both of which exemplified the firm¡¦s poetic reinterpretation of British high-tech traditions. Their success would lead to a string of international commissions that saw Wilkinson preside over a 200-strong firm, with projects ranging from streamlined skyscrapers in China to futuristic botanical gardens in Singapore.The Magna centre began the new millennium with a post-industrial bang. It was a thrilling reinvigoration of a huge redundant steelworks, which was to science what the Tate Modern was to art, both setting the mould for a generation of visitor attractions housed inside dramatic industrial buildings. It took visitors on a theatrical journey along elevated gantries between a series of glowing pods, culminating inside a silvery sci-fi zeppelin hovering in the red-tinged gloom.WilkinsonEyre¡¦s ¡§blinking bridge¡¨ across the Tyne brought similar theatrics to the timeless challenge of how to span a body of water while accommodating the need for ships to pass through. Composed from two graceful parabolic arcs, one forming the pedestrian deck and the other supporting it, it was designed to rotate on an axis, like an opening eyelid, and became an elegant icon of Gateshead¡¦s riverside regeneration that has stood the test of time.The success of these two projects, and the accompanying glare of the media spotlight, prompted the practice to look for work overseas, where it built the sleek Guangzhou International Finance Centre tower, followed by the Gardens By the Bay in Singapore, setting it on the way to becoming a globally recognised firm.Wilkinson was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. His father, Tony, was a surveyor at Unilever, and his mother, Norma (nee Treleaven Beer), had been part of the war effort in her youth. He attended St Alban¡¦s school, where he learned a love of drawing that led him to pursue an art foundation course, before studying architecture at the Polytechnic of Central London (now University of Westminster). Graduating in 1970, he worked for Denys Lasdun on the National Theatre, before taking three months off to travel in Greece where, he said, it became clear that Norman Foster and Richard Rogers were ¡§the future which I wanted to be part of¡¨.He rushed home and applied to work at both firms, and was accepted at Foster¡¦s in 1971. He described it as ¡§an incredible time¡¨, when the practice was still very small and creative, a place where he ¡§learned everything¡¨. He worked mostly with Michael Hopkins, Foster¡¦s partner at the time, and joined Hopkins when he started his own office in 1976, where Wilkinson worked on the Greene King brewery and Willis Faber¡¦s headquarters at 10 Trinity Square. After five years he left to join the Richard Rogers Partnership, where he played a key early role in the design of Lloyd¡¦s of London ¡V which in 2011 became the youngest ever building to be Grade I-listed.Wilkinson¡¦s experience with these three titans of the British high-tech movement was profoundly formative, instilling a love of exposing the structure of buildings and celebrating the latest technologies used to build them. A keen painter, he fused that interest in technology with his own more artistic sensibility, indulging in sensuous curves and more streamlined forms, developing a style that has since become ubiquitous for airports, conference centres and corporate headquarters around the world.He launched his own practice in 1983, and was joined four years later by Jim Eyre, with whom he had worked at Hopkins (the firm was rebranded WilkinsonEyre in 1999). They began with small projects, passed on by Rogers and Hopkins, but their breakthrough came in 1991 when they won the competition for the Stratford Market train depot on the Jubilee line extension. Housing train maintenance and stabling facilities alongside office and ancillary spaces, the building exudes the duo¡¦s interest in heroic steel structures, featuring a diagrid space-frame roof that leaps across the 190-metre-long space in a gentle arc, supported on treelike columns.It embodied many of the principles espoused in Wilkinson¡¦s book Supersheds, published the same year. Described by Building magazine as ¡§the book that put the glamour back into the large-volume, clearspan space¡¨, it was a paean to warehouses, train sheds and other long-span industrial structures, drawing on Wilkinson¡¦s travels in the US. It revived an interest in the potential for ¡§universal space¡¨ covered by suspended canopies, space frames and tensile fabric membranes that would continue throughout the 1990s, influencing the design of everything from stations to supermarkets.Wilkinson¡¦s lean, techno-centric approach attracted the eye of the inventor James Dyson, who commissioned the practice to design his company¡¦s headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 1992, beginning a relationship that continued for three decades. The campus neatly charts the evolution of the firm, from the first undulating roofed factory, to mirrored glass office pavilions, to a recent cluster of modular student accommodation pods for the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology.In a 2019 interview, Wilkinson recalled that Dyson was particularly fond of the flagship store they designed for him in Paris in 2000. ¡§We put all the vacuums on pedestals,¡¨ he said. ¡§They were like artworks. He liked that.¡¨ It began a trend for technology stores designed like contemporary art galleries, which brands such as Apple and Samsung have since taken to extremes.The dawn of the millennium marked a shift in scale. Wilkinson was appointed OBE in the millennium honours list and the lottery-funded Millennium Commission provided a pipeline of substantial opportunities for architects of this generation. WilkinsonEyre profited handsomely, starting with the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea, followed by the Explore@Bristol science centre, which began an interest in working with listed buildings. Then came the celebrated Magna centre and the Gateshead bridge, allowing the practice to grow and projecting the architects to a level of public exposure that, while gratifying, also felt uncomfortable. ¡§It was great in many ways but it caused us a few problems,¡¨ Wilkinson said in an interview last year. ¡§Some articles were written about us that were a bit personal so we decided to lie low for a while rather than making the most of every opportunity that came our way.¡¨They focused on China instead, where they secured the commission for the 440-metre-high Guangzhou Tower. It was a key project for Wilkinson, who increasingly saw the sculptural qualities as more important to their work, keen to introduce a freer artistic approach ¡V while Eyre, the bridge specialist, obsessed over the precise geometry and its rationalisation.Wilkinson¡¦s election to the Royal Academy in 2006 had been a significant moment, encouraging him to enjoy more freedom and take inspiration in his painting and drawing, which became a lifelong passion. He spent the Covid lockdowns painting big abstract acrylic canvases while listening to Pink Floyd and Mozart in his garden-facing dining room, a space he designed in 1996 with full-height frameless glazing and a rooflight inspired by the artist James Turrell.The Guangzhou Tower helped WilkinsonEyre secure further work in Asia, including the Singapore gardens project, conceived as an Avatar-like world of organic glasshouses and strange glowing steel trees. The two projects won the RIBA¡¦s international Lubetkin prize, back-to-back once again, in 2012 and 2013, catapulting the practice into further major global commissions. But the larger the office grew, the more varied became the quality of the work.One of Wilkinson¡¦s most controversial legacies now looms over Sydney¡¦s waterfront, in the form of the 271-metre-high One Barangaroo casino hotel complex, the tallest building in the city, locally nicknamed ¡§Packer¡¦s Pecker¡¨ after its billionaire backer James Packer. Built on a site originally earmarked for parkland, for a developer alleged to facilitate money laundering for criminal gangs, to many eyes the project represents everything that¡¦s wrong with Australia¡¦s anything-goes approach to city planning.Back in the UK, other contentious later works include the Siemens Crystal at the Royal Docks, a contorted glass corporate showcase, soon to be home to the relocated City Hall, and the nearby Emirates Air Line cable car, whose fault lies less in the quality of its design than its questionable usefulness.Over his 40-year career, the project Wilkinson said he was most proud of was the Maggie¡¦s Centre at the Churchill hospital in Oxford, built in 2014. Conceived as an angular treehouse, it explored the possibilities of cross-laminated timber and his passion for freer geometries, which Eyre suggests reflected his love of jazz music. His last realised building will be the Dodington Art Gallery for James and Deirdre Dyson on the couple¡¦s estate, due to open in 2023 ¡V fittingly bringing his passions full circle, with a slender diagrid roof covering a clear-span space below.Wilkinson is survived by his wife, Diana (nee Edmunds), whom he married in 1976, and their children, Zoe and Dominic.',\n",
              " 'The extent of Boris Johnson¡¦s U-turn on the Parthenon marbles has been laid bare in a 1986 article unearthed in an Oxford library in which the then classics student argued passionately for their return to Athens.Deploying language that would make campaigners proud, Johnson not only believed the fifth century BC antiquities should be displayed ¡§where they belong¡¨, but deplored how they had been ¡§sawed and hacked¡¨ from the magisterial edifice they once adorned.¡§The Elgin marbles should leave this northern whisky-drinking guilt-culture, and be displayed where they belong: in a country of bright sunshine and the landscape of Achilles, ¡¥the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea,¡¦¡¨ he wrote in the article, republished by the Greek daily, Ta Nea, on Saturday.¡§They will be housed in a new museum a few hundred yards from the Acropolis. They will be meticulously cared for. They will not, as they were in the British Museum in 1938, be severely damaged by manic washerwomen scrubbing them with copper brushes.¡¨Last month the British prime minister told his Greek counterpart that the carvings ¡V part of a monumental frieze regarded as the high point of classical art ¡V were legally acquired and must remain in London. About half of the artworks are exhibited in the British Museum.The Greek premier, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has reinvigorated the campaign to have them reunited with the rest of the frieze in Athens.Published in Debate, once the official magazine of the Oxford Union Society, Johnson¡¦s 978-word article offers indubitable proof of how sympathetic he was as a young man to the Greek cause. Since going into politics, the Tory has rebuffed any notion of repatriation. In a 2012 letter, shared with the Guardian, the then mayor of London acknowledged that while, ideally, the sculptures should have remained in situ, their removal from the British Museum would amount to ¡§grievous and irremediable loss¡¨.In November, a No 10 spokesperson said: ¡§It is the longstanding position of the prime minister and the UK government that the Parthenon sculptures were acquired legally in accordance with the law at the time.¡¨The article, which is not available online and might have languished in obscurity had it not been for Ta Nea¡¦s London-based correspondent, Yannis Andritsopoulos, discovering the magazine in the Oxford library ¡V is testimony to how big his about-turn has been.Johnson, who was 21 at the time, penned the polemic before a visit to the Oxford Union by Melina Mercouri, the Greek culture minister who first raised the issue of the marbles¡¦ restitution.As president of the union, the classicist had invited Mercouri, a celebrated former actor, to be the main speaker at a debate on 12 June 1986, entitled: ¡§This house believes that the Elgin marbles must be returned to Athens.¡¨It was a fiery speech that would see her win the vote.The Debate article laid the groundwork for the event. In it, Johnson sided with Mercouri, debunking the notion that Lord Elgin had lawfully acquired the statuary as England¡¦s ambassador to the Sublime Porte and even going so far as to accuse the British government of ¡§sophistry and intransigence¡¨.¡§Powerful forces will cause her Mercouri to fly to Britain. They are on the one hand the passionate national feeling of the Greek people, and on the other the sophistry and intransigence of the British government,¡¨ he wrote. ¡§And caught between these forces is, not a sack of old balls, but the supreme artistic treasure of the ancient world. The debate on 12 June will mark the climax of a renewed campaign by the Greek government to restore to Greece the sculptural embodiment of the spirit of the nation.¡¨Johnson also had some choice words for Elgin, saying the Scottish peer had not only exploited the ¡§near anarchy¡¨ of the times to remove the pieces when Greece was without voice as a ¡§tumbledown outpost of the Ottoman empire¡¨, but had sought to obtain them to amuse his ¡§young and skittish wife¡¨ who had ¡§a pampered girl¡¦s insatiable desire for presents¡¨.¡§It was in the Acropolis that he realised he had found a few things that might amuse her. Manipulating Turkish dependence on Britain for military support, he secured from the Sultan a firman to remove ¡¥qualche pezzi di pietra¡¦ ¡V a few pieces of stone ¡V that happened to be lying about on the Acropolis,¡¨ the young Johnson wrote.¡§Elgin¡¦s interpretation of this phrase was liberal to say the least.¡¨',\n",
              " 'Richard Rogers, who has died aged 88, changed the face of urban Britain more than any other architect of the late 20th century. He was author of the groundbreaking Lloyd¡¦s building in the City of London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, but his impact was manifest less in his own buildings than in his influence on public policy, which saw a fundamental shift in the perception of inner cities away from being something to endure or escape, to being something desirable to enjoy. He ushered in the era of ¡§regeneration¡¨, seeing British cities adorned with canal-side apartments and cafe-lined squares, if sometimes at a cost to existing communities.Shortly after New Labour came to power in the landslide election of 1997, Rogers was appointed to chair the Urban Task Force, a quango charged with identifying the causes of urban decline in England and recommending practical solutions to bringing people back into cities and putting an end to suburban sprawl. The findings, published as Towards an Urban Renaissance in 1999, called for a new generation of ¡§compact cities¡¨, advocating the redevelopment of post-industrial brownfield land with high-density flats, shops and cafes, along with investment in public transport, public spaces and public facilities. Five years later, housing densities had risen from an average of 25 to 40 dwellings per hectare, and 70% of development was on brownfield land. Rogers¡¦ principles would define the model of urban regeneration for the coming decades, for better and worse.His vision was presented as one of inclusivity and equality, but it would also foster greater displacement and division, producing a form of investment-fuelled development that saw his own practice design some of the most expensive housing ever built. While the socialist Labour peer argued for a city for all, his office was designing the fortified luxury apartment schemes of One Hyde Park, Neo Bankside and Riverlight, stacks of investment units that became symbols of London¡¦s extreme inequality.Rogers often credited his urbane, cosmopolitan outlook to his Italian upbringing. He was born in Florence, in an apartment with a view of the Duomo. His father, Nino, was a doctor, whose own father, a dentist, was a British ?migr? to Italy. His mother, Dada (nee Geiringer), was an art-lover, who became a potter. She was the daughter of an architect and engineer from a notable Trieste family, and had once been taught English by James Joyce.They moved to Britain in 1939 to escape the rise of fascism, finding lodging in a single room in a boarding house in Bayswater with a coin meter for the heating and a bath in a cupboard. Cold, smoggy London at a time of rationing was a culture shock for the young Rogers. As he later recalled, ¡§life switched from colour to black and white¡¨. He was sent to Kingswood House boarding school in Epsom, a place he described as ¡§brutal and unfair¡¨, where he was regularly beaten and bullied, an experience that prompted him to become a good boxer. He grew in confidence at St John¡¦s school in Leatherhead, where he discovered sporting ability, but he struggled with dyslexia and left school in 1951 without A-levels.It was during these years, Rogers later wrote, that he realised there was more strength in working as a group than being a solo high achiever, an outlook that would go on to inform his collaborative model of practice. During a major retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy to mark Rogers¡¦s 80th birthday, the curators admitted that they struggled to find a single drawing by the man himself.Rogers spent his national service stationed in Trieste, which proved to be a formative period. While on leave, he worked in the office of his cousin Ernesto Rogers, the feted architect of the Torre Velasca in Milan, which inspired him to apply to study at the Architectural Association on his return to London. He was an enthusiastic, if inconsistent, student. A tutor¡¦s report in 1958 described his work as ¡§chaotic and inarticulate¡¨, but he impressed the examiners with his final project, a school for children with special educational needs in Wales, using locally grown timber and designed so that the pupils could participate in building. One of Rogers¡¦s tutors, the brutalist architect Peter Smithson, noted his ¡§capacity for worrying about the effect the building will have on people and a concern for shape on the inside,¡¨ which would prove to be a constant theme.Rogers met Su Brumwell in his third year. She was studying sociology at the London School of Economics and her parents were socialists, with deep roots in the Labour movement, giving Rogers early exposure to the political left. They married in 1960 and travelled to Yale the following year on a Fulbright scholarship, after Rogers spent a short spell working at Middlesex county council¡¦s architects¡¦ department. At Yale he met Norman Foster, and was taught by Paul Rudolph, whose designs for Yale¡¦s Art and Architecture Building would have a great influence on his own designs for the Lloyd¡¦s building years later. After graduating, he worked briefly in the San Francisco office of the corporate firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which provided a useful lesson. ¡§I quickly came to realise,¡¨ he wrote, ¡§that working in someone else¡¦s architectural practice was not for me.¡¨On returning to the UK, Rogers, Brumwell and Foster, along with Foster¡¦s wife Wendy Cheesman, set up a practice, Team 4, and began by designing a house for Brumwell¡¦s parents in Cornwall, called Creek Vean. It was a steep learning curve. It took six years, almost bankrupted both the designers and their client, and saw Rogers and Foster summoned to the Architects Registration Council for practising without a licence. Their factory in Swindon for Reliance Controls, built in 1967, had a smoother ride. In its use of standardised industrial components, this elegant shed presaged the direction Rogers¡¦ work would go on to take.The following year, after Team 4 split up, he and Su developed the ZipUp House, a prototype home designed to be assembled quickly and cheaply from insulated panels of the kind used for refrigerated trucks. ¡§Buying clothes off the rack is the norm,¡¨ Rogers wrote. ¡§We wanted to do the same for the house ¡V an affordable, speedy kit of parts.¡¨ The concept was never realised, but the thinking influenced Parkside, the modular house he built for his parents in Wimbledon. A model of the ZipUp house, a streamlined yellow pod on bright pink legs, stood in the foyer of his office for decades to come, as the original high-tech, factory-assembled dream from which all else would be spawned.Rogers¡¦ technology-driven production line principles would soon be explored on a much larger scale in a project that would change his career forever. In 1969 the French president, Georges Pompidou, announced a competition for a new multidisciplinary cultural centre on the vacant site of the Plateau Beaubourg in Paris. Rogers teamed up with the Italian architect Renzo Piano, to whom he had been introduced by his doctor, and, together, they dreamt up the most radical proposal of their lives.Their scheme for the Centre Pompidou was to be a great oil refinery of art, a mechanical transformer of a building, inspired by the comic book fantasies of Archigram and Cedric Price for a new kind of robotic architecture that would respond to changing needs, with plug-in components and moving floors.Huge digital screens would entertain crowds on a great sloping piazza outside, while escalators in glass tubes would shuttle people up the building¡¦s facade, forming a dynamic backdrop to the mime artists and musicians down below. It was saturated with colour, its exposed pipes and ducts painted in the bright reds, blues and greens of the media age ¡V a feature that would continue in Rogers¡¦s work for years to come. The point, he said, was that ¡§culture should be fun¡¨.Their winning sci-fi vision met with a frosty reception in Paris. The architects were booed at the press conference, where balls of paper were hurled, along with accusations that they were building a low-brow supermarket of culture, an ocean liner run aground in the Marais, and a jungle gym for King Kong. Pompidou died and his successor cut the budget. The screens were dropped, the floors did not move and fire regulations curtailed some of the more daring ideas. Pressure groups filed lawsuits against the project, the Guardian¡¦s art critic said the ¡§hideous¡¨ object should be covered with Virginia creeper, while Robert Delaunay¡¦s widow Sonia said she would rather burn his paintings than have them exhibited in the building.But the architects were vindicated by the public reaction: visitor numbers were five times those predicted. Around seven million people visited in the first year, more than the Louvre and Eiffel Tower combined. The Pompidou Centre marked a watershed: it was both a late flowering of 1960s utopianism and a premonition of the city-boosting ¡§iconic¡¨ cultural architecture that would define urban regeneration in the decades to follow.The Parisian cultural tanker set the aesthetic and ideological agenda for the Richard Rogers Partnership, later Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, which Rogers founded in 1977 on his return to London. Structure would be exposed and express what it was doing, in as didactic a way as possible. It would be jauntily coloured too, matching Rogers¡¦s vivid wardrobe of neon braces and acid-hued shirts. The ambition was to make buildings lighter and more flexible, to minimise structure while maximising space and light, and reduce demands on energy and the natural environment, in pursuit of a kind of technological sublime.In London, the thrilling potentials of this high-tech age were first proved in the new headquarters for the insurance giant Lloyd¡¦s of London, completed in 1986. Formed of three towers around a 60-metre high atrium, lit by a huge barrel-vaulted glass roof, its most radical move was to place the service cores outside the building. This freed up more floorspace for desks, and provided Rogers with a chance to revel in the sculptural forms of staircases, glass lifts and toilet pods on the facade, composing a vertical symphony of polished stainless steel.It suffered a similar critical reception to the Pompidou at the time ¡V it was subjected to accusations of ¡§bowellism¡¨, for presenting its innards on the outside ¡V but it has since been recognised as one of the most significant buildings of the 20th century, in 2011 becoming the youngest structure to be Grade I-listed.Two years later, RSH+P completed the Leadenhall Building across the street, a tapering behemoth almost three times the height of Lloyd¡¦s, known as the Cheesegrater, which followed similar principles, placing services to the north to free up the floors and creating an animated ballet of lifts on the facade. In a nod to creating more public space, the tower was raised on legs, 30 metres up in the air, although the heavily-managed plaza beneath has the feeling of a high-security lobby.The 1980s also saw Rogers begin to take a more prominent role in public life. In an exhibition at the Royal Academy, titled London As It Could Be, he set out ambitious plans for the capital, together with Foster and James Stirling, including burying the road along the Victoria Embankment to create a pedestrian-friendly public riverside, introducing new lightweight footbridges across the Thames and banishing traffic from the north side of Trafalgar Square ¡V some of which ultimately happened in different forms.Rogers increasingly saw it as his duty to defend the cause of contemporary architecture against more conservative forces. In a series of high-profile speeches throughout the 1980s, the Prince of Wales launched a tirade of attacks on modern architecture, famously describing a proposed steel and glass extension to the National Gallery as ¡§a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend.¡¨ In a speech to the Corporation of London¡¦s planning committee in 1987, referring to Rogers¡¦s proposals for Paternoster Square, he said: ¡§You have to give this much credit to the Luftwaffe: when it knocked down our buildings, it didn¡¦t replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.¡¨So the style wars began. Rogers responded with a long article in the Times, rejecting the Prince¡¦s ¡§Disneyland approach¡¨ of bolting on ¡§disposable symbols like decomposed classical columns, pediments and cornices, or flimsy Gothic turrets and Egyptian palm trees,¡¨ and attacking his misuse of royal privilege to intervene in the planning system. Rogers maintained that the Prince¡¦s interventions behind the scenes cost his firm work on a number of major projects throughout his career, including the transformation of the Royal Opera House and, most contentiously, his masterplan for Chelsea Barracks, which was shelved in 2009 after Prince Charles contacted the Qatari royal family.If the Prince wielded power behind the scenes, Rogers himself enjoyed a very public platform. He set out his vision for a new generation of sustainable compact cities in the Reith Lectures in 1995, published as Cities for a Small Planet two years later. In 1996 he was made a Labour peer, as Lord Rogers of Riverside. As the chair of the Urban Task Force, he argued for densely populated hubs linked by public transport, walking and cycling, and championed ¡§the urban environment¡¦s capacity to emancipate and civilise, rather than segregate and disempower¡¨.With the establishment of the Greater London Authority in 2000, and the election of Ken Livingstone as the first mayor of London, Rogers was appointed to head up the new Architecture and Urbanism Unit, charged with improving design quality in the capital. ¡§Ken wanted us to influence more than policy,¡¨ Rogers wrote. ¡§He wanted us to make things happen.¡¨The A+UU published design guides on streetscape, housing, density and green space, mapped high streets and town centres to identify opportunities for infill development, and launched a plan for 100 new public spaces across London. Only a few of these flagship projects were ever completed, but the A+UU played an influential role in putting design at the top of London¡¦s political agenda ¡V something that was swiftly removed by the next mayor, Boris Johnson, much to Rogers¡¦s fury.While the built output of his practice never quite matched the visceral thrill of the Pompidou or Lloyd¡¦s again, Rogers continued to produce elegant and engaging public buildings, from the law courts in Bordeaux and Antwerp to the National Assembly in Wales, where an image of transparency and public accessibility were always central. His tensile white tent for the Millennium Dome, while deemed a failure at the time, has gone on to house one of the most successful live performance venues in the world, in the form of the O2 Arena.Rogers was awarded the RIBA gold medal and Pritzker prize, and won the Stirling prize twice, for the Barajas airport, Madrid in 2006 and the Maggie¡¦s Centre at Charing Cross hospital in 2009. The former is a rare thing: an airport that does not make you want to escape as soon as you have entered. With its undulating bamboo roof floating above an avenue of branching rainbow-coloured columns, it is a calming place that soothes the stress of international travel. It took just eight years from conception to completion, a stark contrast to Rogers¡¦ scheme for Heathrow Terminal 5, which was subjected to the longest public inquiry in British history and took 19 years to be built. As a result, it seemed outdated by the time it opened.Outside the office, Rogers¡¦s home life was a constant whirlwind of family and entertaining, conducted in a magnificent Georgian house on Royal Avenue in Chelsea, which he gutted to form a vertical stack of spaces around one gigantic triple-height room, nicknamed the piazza. Decorated with artwork by Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly and Philip Guston, it was a lively social hub where he and his second wife, Ruth (nee Elias), co-founder of the River Cafe, whom he had married in 1973, hosted parties and charity benefits for their extensive network of friends. It was a welcoming place, where nosy guests were encouraged to feel at home and explore, discovering everything from the bright green Lino in the loo to the neatly ordered rainbow landscape of Rogers¡¦s sock drawer ¡V which once inspired a dedicated article in the New Yorker.While he lived in a converted Georgian terrace, Rogers always espoused a future of modular homes that could be built on a production line, although he never quite achieved his goal. The main prefab housing scheme he realised was a group of suburban homes for Taylor Wimpey at Oxley Woods in Milton Keynes, in 2007, which were plagued by leaks and legal claims. The practice also developed a ¡§Homeshell¡¨ concept for prefabricated flat-pack housing, which they trialled on several sites in London, but have yet to succeed in scaling up. By contrast, his office enjoyed huge success in the luxury apartment sector, producing gleaming glass towers of flats across London, Monaco and Taipei.¡§Our society has decided ¡K that we will tolerate this worsening level of inequality, despite the fact that it is socially corrosive and economically inefficient,¡¨ Rogers wrote in his 2017 memoir, A Place for All People. ¡§Our politics cannot be made a slave to the narrow interests of the super-rich.¡¨ As time went on, the gulf between what he espoused for the greater public good, and what his practice actually did for the elite few, grew ever wider. Nonetheless, he will be remembered for a series of radically innovative buildings, which still have the power to shock 40 years on, and for putting the importance of sustainable, liveable cities at the top of the political agenda.He is survived by Ruth and their son Roo; and by three sons, Ben, Zad and Ab, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce; and by 13 grandchildren. His youngest son, Bo, died in 2011.',\n",
              " 'One of Britain¡¦s most celebrated architects, Richard Rogers, known for designing some of the world¡¦s most famous buildings including Paris¡¦ Pompidou Centre, has died aged 88.Rogers, who changed the London skyline with distinctive creations such as the Millennium Dome and the ¡¥Cheesegrater¡¦ Leadenhall Building, ¡§passed away quietly¡¨ Saturday night, publicist Matthew Freud told the Press Association.His son Roo Rogers also confirmed his death to the New York Times, but did not give the cause.Fellow architect, Norman Foster, described Rogers, as a ¡§kindred spirit¡¨ whose buildings are ¡§a social mirror¡¨ of his personality - ¡§open, welcoming and, like his wardrobe, elegantly colourful¡¨. Foster, who studied alongside Rogers at Yale, would go on to collaborate with him as Team 4, alongside Su Brumwell and Wendy Cheesman.Describing Rogers as ¡§a tireless supporter of the compact, sustainable, pedestrian-friendly city and a passionate opponent of mindless suburban sprawl¡¨, Foster said that he had ¡§fire in his belly¡K up to the very end¡¨.Paying tribute, former colleagues from Rogers, Stirk, Harbour + Partners, described a man who ¡§was gregarious, always completely free of status, always inclusive, always exploring and looking ahead¡¨. He retired last year from the architecture practice he founded in 1977. A statement said Rogers was a man of ¡§immense drive and charisma¡¨ with a love of people, highlighting his political commitment to positive social change.Director Ivan Harbour, said: ¡§I will never forget his wry smile, his infectious laugh, his paternal nature, and his sharp intellect. He was not an archetypical architect, but he was a unique and wonderful human being.¡¨He was married to River Cafe cook and writer Ruth Rogers, and had five grown-up children ¡V three from a previous marriage to Brumwell ¡V and 13 grandchildren. His son Bo died in 2011 at 27 from a seizure.The Italian-born architect won a series of awards for his designs, including the 2007 Pritzker Prize, and was one of the pioneers of the ¡§high-tech¡¨ architecture movement, distinguished by structures incorporating industrial materials such as glass and steel. He was the co-creator of France¡¦s Pompidou Centre ¡V opened in 1977 and famed for its multi-coloured, pipe-covered facade ¡V which he designed with Italian architect Renzo Piano.Rogers¡¦ other well-known designs include Strasbourg¡¦s European court of human rights and the Three World Trade Center in New York, as well as international airport terminals in Madrid and London¡¦s Heathrow, and the Welsh Senedd. He advised Tony Blair, who awarded him a peerage in 1996, and Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. He quit as mayoral aide under the latter, accusing Johnson and his team of blocking attempts to design public spaces in London. He was also awarded the L?gion d¡¦Honneur in 1986, and knighted in 1991.Born in Florence in 1933, his father was a doctor and his mother a former pupil of the famed Irish writer James Joyce. The family fled the dictatorship of Mussolini, settling in England in 1939, when Rogers was six.It was not an easy adjustment. The family, comfortably middle-class in Italy, lived in a single-room flat in Bayswater, London, that ran on a coin metre for heating and a bath in the cupboard.¡§Life had switched from colour to black-and-white,¡¨ Rogers recalled in his 2017 autobiography ¡§A Place for all People¡¨.School was no easier either. Rogers was dyslexic at a time when there was no diagnosis for the condition and he was ¡§called stupid¡¨, he told the Observer in 2017.He was miserable, he said in his autobiography, ¡§crying myself to sleep every night - years of unhappiness¡¨. Happier in later years, he described his upbringing by his leftist parents as ¡§strict in some ways. But as a teenager, they didn¡¦t mind who I slept with, so long as she was there for breakfast. I was brought up to be free.¡¨After the war, his family could return to Italy for summers, and he described his adventures travelling independently from 17, writing, ¡§I ran with the bulls in Pamplona, and dodged ticket collectors by hanging on the outside of trains; I spent a night in the cells in San Sebastian after being arrested by the Franco-ist Guardia Civil for swimming naked in the sea.¡¨He left school in 1951 with no qualifications but managed to gain entry into London¡¦s Architectural Association School, known for its modernism. He completed his architecture studies at Yale in the United States in 1962, where he met Foster.Although buildings were Rogers¡¦ world, he insisted it was the space around them that was key in defining those that worked.¡§The two can¡¦t be judged apart,¡¨ he told the Guardian in 2017.¡§The Twin Towers in New York, for instance. They weren¡¦t great buildings, but the space between them was.¡¨',\n",

Open Studio strives for harmony with the environment in design and materials used. Its best-known work is the UCCA Dune Art Museum built into a beach in Bohai Bay. The Chapel of Sound is similarly elemental, built like a rock and open to the elements. Open Studio was founded by Li Hu and Huang Wenjing and their comments on their new work seem to sum up the new Chinese ethos: ¡§We are at a time when the question of our relationship with nature as human beings is more acute than ever. Can we be humble enough to hear what nature is murmuring to us? We wanted to create something different, something meaningful.¡¨Today we¡¦re familiar with the idea of a man cave as a place for the male of the species to get some precious alone time. The same concept was present in mid-Century, post-modern Italian design ¡V albeit in a rather more stylish incarnation.In the mid-1960s, the architect, designer and Memphis Group founder Ettore Sottsass built Sala Sottsass, a ¡§room within a room¡¨, in Casa Lana, the Milan home of a typographer friend. Sottsass was intrigued by the relationship between men, their needs and their rituals, and the inhabited space. So Sala Sottsass consisted of a wooden structure with sofas arranged so that they formed a ¡§protected space¡¨ to sit, chat and listen to music.The project has never been seen by the public but now the Sottsass Archive has meticulously rebuilt it in Triennale di Milano, the design and art museum in Lombardy. To accompany the installation, the Triennale has organised three exhibitions throughout 2022 that will look deeper into the world of Sottsass.In the meantime, any men shuffling off to the spare room for some peace and quiet this Christmas might like to gaze on this ¡§little piazza¡K where one can move and meet¡¨ as Sottsass himself put it in 1967 ¡V and dream.For more information on the upcoming Sottsass exhibitions, check the Triennale websiteSkip Gallery was founded in 2017 by curators and artists Lee Baker and Catherine Borowski in, yes, a skip. ¡§We couldn¡¦t find anywhere to show our work, but Borowski came up with the bright idea of dropping a skip as a gallery into a parking space and our bonkers project was born,¡¨ says Baker.

Marcel Duchamp helped stage a retrospective of her work two years after her death in 1944, and Andy Warhol said she was his favourite artist. Stettheimer was celebrated for her poetry, costume design and theatre sets, but perhaps one of her most significant accomplishments was a painting which has been described as the first nude self-portrait from the perspective of the ¡§female gaze¡¨, completed back in 1915.After spending her early years in Europe, she and her sisters, Carrie and Ettie, helped introduce the modernist movement to America and supported the Harlem Renaissance through their Bryant Park salon in New York. The Stetties, as the sisters were known, each had their own creative pursuit. Carrie created a doll-house containing an art collection of miniatures donated by their artist friends. Ettie wrote feminist novels under the pseudonym Henrie Waste. Florine made overtly political artworks long before it was the norm ¡V addressing gender identity, segregation and women¡¦s rights, as well as the burgeoning avant garde scene in her native New York.A new biography by art historian Barbara Bloemink focuses on these more political works and brings new focus to the innovative artist, reminding the world that behind her faux-naive style ¡V so beloved by Warhol ¡V was an intelligent woman, way ahead of her time.Florine Stettheimer, a Biography (Hirmer Publishing/ University of Chicago Press,) is published 24 JanuaryFollowing on from the release of 2020¡¦s gingerbread Ikea furniture, new festive edible design projects have materialised this year. American designer Kelly Wearstler made a limited edition California Modern-style gingerbread house with LA food company Flamingo Estate, with all proceeds going to Create Structure, a charity that helps communities rebuild with sustainable housing after natural disasters.Swedish studio Ulf Mejergren Architects (UMA) decided to see how they could use gingerbread biscuits and created an edible hut out of the festive cookies.

Today she¡¦s in the character of Listey Cat; Lucy¡¦s work revolves around her love of animals, which often manifests in the form of the bright, elaborate costumes she makes and has worn to give gallery tours. ¡§It¡¦s given us more independence and we get to work with other artists,¡¨ she says, of the collective. ¡§I feel lucky and chill. It¡¦s therapeutic.¡¨Founded in 1996, Project Art Works collaborates with neurodiverse artists and those with complex support needs, providing them with studio space, materials and facilitators. Tom, who works with lead artist Lucy, is like many of the facilitators also an artist, and is keen to stress the collaborative nature of the practice: ¡§It¡¦s a mutual experience,¡¨ he says. ¡§I support Lucy and she supports me.¡¨Neurodiversity has become something of a buzzword in recent years. It¡¦s about replacing the stigmatisation of people with conditions such as autism with the recognition that these are simply normal variations, with qualities of their own. The Turner nomination suggests that the art world finally seems to be catching on. Though perhaps not fast enough, if some of the attitudes Project Art Works CEO and artist director Kate Adams has encountered are anything to go by: ¡§It was only about six years ago that a head of exhibition somewhere within an organisation said to us, ¡¥I don¡¦t think it¡¦s right to have people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn¡¦t be in the same building.¡¦¡¨Such attitudes have been infuriatingly commonplace. Adams co-founded Project Art Works with fellow artist Jonathan Cole after attending neurodiverse classrooms with her son, who has complex needs, and noting the high standard of the work. Special schools were ¡§these fantastic anarchic little kingdoms¡¨, Adams tells me, producing talented artists the art world was oblivious to, and who lacked practical support. She set out with two goals in mind: to help create connections with individuals who are sometimes hard to reach, and to change perceptions though showing the work they were making.¡§It¡¦s really important within an exhibition to curate a gradual insight in where the work comes from,¡¨ she says. ¡§That tends to have a really good impact on people, because they¡¦re seduced by these incredible artworks, many of which are extraordinary, abstract, spirited images. And then there¡¦s a sort of deeper insight into how they were made and who they were made by.¡¨Audiences, perhaps being less hung up on an artist¡¦s background or identity, have always responded well. But it isn¡¦t the audiences who are the problem. Project Art Works have spent years trying to open up institutions using the methodology they established, and for which they received Arts Council funding in 2017. Some, like MK Gallery in Milton Keynes, have been very receptive, but it hasn¡¦t always been easy. ¡§It¡¦s been really hard to open up the cultural sector,¡¨ Adams says. ¡§It is incredibly conservative, especially contemporary visual arts because it¡¦s so aligned with theory, commerce and ego,¡¨ she says.Adams believes that they have benefited from what she calls ¡§an existential crisis in the cultural sector about what it¡¦s for. Covid has propelled that. And I think that¡¦s one of the reasons why the Turner prize this year is artists¡¦ collectives.¡¨ When they got the nomination, however, they still had to brace themselves. How has it been? ¡§Interesting,¡¨ is the response. Some of the coverage has been patronising and dismissive, putting Project Art Works in a box marked ¡§charity¡¨ and invoking a word that we both confess to hating: ¡§worthy¡¨.¡§That is a big put-down. It¡¦s also a way of putting us in a box that says this isn¡¦t real. We don¡¦t need to take them seriously, they¡¦re not real artists,¡¨ says Adams. ¡§It¡¦s a disgraceful aberration of actual thinking about what people are seeing.¡¨Critics, she says, are heavily invested in the idea of the ¡§artist with a capital A¡¨, so this sort of collaborative practice simply doesn¡¦t seem to compute. Nor does the fact that autism doesn¡¦t somehow preclude a person from being an artist. ¡§We never talk about our work as outsider art. It¡¦s just art,¡¨ says Adams. People are hopefully starting to recognise this. ¡§I think we¡¦re in a moment. I can¡¦t say that I absolutely trust it. But it¡¦s a good move in the right direction.¡¨In London, Studio Voltaire is currently hosting the first significant survey outside of the US of the American artist William Scott¡¦s prolific 30¡Vyear practice. It features among its 80 works Scott¡¦s utopian depictions of an alternative San Francisco, known as Praise Frisco, an inclusive place free from crime and violence, and his portraits of black politicians, celebrities and activists including Maya Angelou, Prince and Barack Obama. Refreshingly, the materials surrounding the exhibition focus on Scott¡¦s status as an artist in his own right ¡V as opposed to his dual diagnosis of autism and schizophrenia ¡V and his artistic concern with community, activism and urban development.The Studio Voltaire exhibition is a collaboration with Creative Growth, a non-profit in Oakland, California, where Scott has practiced since 1992. It is here that I find him when I call him over Zoom to discuss his work and practice. His emphasis on ¡§wholesome encounters¡¨, he tells me, comes from a utopian desire to create a better city. ¡§There was too much violence on the news,¡¨ he says, of his interest in architectural painting. ¡§That¡¦s why it makes me draw new cities ¡K I can make a new world when I paint.¡¨Creative Growth doesn¡¦t just provide space, materials and facilitators for neurodiverse artists; it also acts as agents, bridging the gap between them and the art world. It¡¦s been running since 1974, so they¡¦ve witnessed a lot of change over the decades, though, as gallery director Sarah Galender Meyer points out, it¡¦s been something of a slow burn when you consider that Jean Dubuffet introduced the concept of art brut in the 1940s.¡§Even in the past 10 years, there has been quite an increase in acceptance and excitement in the art world,¡¨ Meyer says. ¡§It¡¦s really being embraced, even without being under the umbrella term of ¡¥outsider art¡¦, or ¡¥self-taught¡¦, which is used, and it¡¦s fine, but I think that they¡¦re just contemporary artists. They warrant the same kind of inquiry that other artists do.¡¨At the heart of this acceptance, Meyer thinks, may be the dawning understanding that neurodiverse artists offer something new and exciting. ¡§Collectors and institutions and galleries ¡K everybody¡¦s really interested in our artists¡¦ process. And in their work, as well. It¡¦s not like anything that anybody¡¦s seen before. It¡¦s different than somebody coming out of an MFA programme.¡¨The discovery of neurodiverse artists is often led by other artists, she tells me. ¡§It has typically been a pattern that contemporary artists are the first to discover and applaud the work of self-taught artists. They themselves are steeped in artistic process and are attracted to other artists that embody innovative practices.¡¨That¡¦s not to say that there isn¡¦t work to do in changing perceptions. ¡§Even in major exhibitions they are not always received as contemporary artists, which further marginalises their work,¡¨ says Meyer. ¡§There is an assumption that unless an artist has received formal training and respond to the canon, their process is not ¡¥legitimate¡¦.¡¨Encouraging artists to speak for themselves is part of Creative Growth¡¦s ethos. As Scott says, ¡§art can help make the world better. It will bring peace to the world, and bringing peace makes people feel lucky and happier.¡¨Later that week I¡¦m at Hart Club, a studio space in an old estate agent¡¦s shop in Lambeth, London, looking at some of the work its members have produced. Though much smaller and much newer than Creative Growth and Project Art Works, it shares with them a dedication to championing neurodiversity in the arts by working closely with small groups of neurodiverse artists and exhibiting their work.I¡¦m here to meet Yangdzom Lama, an artist who works here, and whose paintings are like a beautiful, colourful mix of Frida Kahlo-esque symbolism and Tibetan thangka paintings of Buddhist deities. ¡§I don¡¦t remember this, but my dad used to be a thangka painter, and apparently I used to watch him when I was really little. So I guess all the colours got ingrained into my life.¡¨¡§I¡¦d love to be in exhibitions in galleries. That would be a dream come true,¡¨ Lama says, when I ask what she hopes for. Hart Club has given her happiness and a sense of community. ¡§I did a term of art school at Camberwell College of Arts but I didn¡¦t really like that,¡¨ she says. ¡§There was just too many people (there were 600 on art foundation). At the time, I didn¡¦t know that I was on the autism spectrum either.¡¨¡§One thing that¡¦s really wonderful about Hart Club is they know that I¡¦m on the spectrum and they¡¦re really accommodating towards that and just really nice. Back in Camberwell, I felt like they weren¡¦t really aware of that kind of thing.¡¨ It wasn¡¦t that she didn¡¦t make friends at art school, she explains, so much as the fact that the tutors felt very removed. ¡§It was hard to figure out who you could ask for assistance.¡¨Hart Club was set up by artist and art school graduate Helen Ralli in 2018 after she worked on an exhibition of neurodiverse artists¡¦ work called Great Minds Think Different. ¡§I was really blown away by the work that I saw,¡¨ she says. But there was a disconnect between the work¡¦s quality and where it was being seen, which was mostly limited to a community setting, so she resolved to provide a platform for some of the artists to exhibit. ¡§Those events were a really mixed crowd, very different from the kind of typical art openings that I personally was experiencing before,¡¨ says Ralli.Neurodiverse people are often excluded from such environments, not to mention art school. Ralli said she saw first-hand how ¡§incredibly selective¡¨ it is: ¡§It felt lacking in terms of a creative environment, because it was the same people.¡¨ Hart Club is an alternative that aims to provide time, materials and encouragement in a nonhierarchical environment, with an emphasis on co-working. ¡§I don¡¦t think it¡¦s about emulating the existing structures. It¡¦s not about ticking boxes. It¡¦s about having to completely rework and rewrite what creative spaces look like.¡¨Like others in the field, Ralli finds the charity label problematic. ¡§That¡¦s really not what¡¦s happening here,¡¨ she says. ¡§Whether they¡¦re a facilitator, or one of the artists, everyone is learning.¡¨ She also stresses that a diverse environment is a gift to be embraced by neurotypical artists as well. ¡§Until you¡¦ve really experienced what it is to have a culturally diverse space, I don¡¦t think the true value of it is understood. This is more exciting, enhancing and enriching.¡¨',\n",

              " 'What can be said of a world where one billionaire wants to build a giant tulip-shaped tower of little practical use and another wants to house thousands of students in windowless rooms in a block with all the charm of an Amazon distribution centre? The first, designed by Foster + Partners for the Brazilian Jacob Safra, was supposed somehow to boost confidence in the City of London by building what would have been only the world¡¦s second highest flower-themed absurdity, a taller Lotus Tower having already been built in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The second, Munger Hall, is the dormitory for the University of California, Santa Barbara, where in return for donating 200m of the 1.5bn cost the 97-year-old Charlie Munger is insisting that 94% of residents have no natural light in their rooms.At least the British government saw sense and refused the Tulip planning permission, whereas plans are still proceeding for Munger Hall. Both projects seem driven by ego, but in the wide space between the brutal functionalism of the latter and the redundant gesturing of the former you might hope to find places where beauty is put in the service of the usual and unusual needs of human life. My top five, I submit, achieve this.In climate emergency news, there was a bit of a fad this year for temporarily relocating trees in places where you don¡¦t usually find them ¡V in the courtyard of Somerset House, out the back of Tate Modern, on a ¡§mound¡¨ at Marble Arch. The idea was to say something or other about the importance of having nature in cities, but any suspicion that these projects were, like the Tulip, a teeny bit gestural was resoundingly confirmed by the contrast between the lush landscape that publicity images promised for the mound and the bedraggled reality.More usefully and less glamorously, it continues to sink into public and official consciousness that it¡¦s environmentally good to refit buildings where possible rather than rebuild them ¡V that there¡¦s little point in sinking huge carbon and energy costs in a building that might give some payback in a few decades¡¦ time. Progress was also made with the technology of building large structures with timber ¡V by no means a cure-all for issues of sustainability but a step in the right direction.The boggling horrors of the Grenfell Tower inquiry continue to unfold. Stories keep coming out of failures by manufacturers, regulators, contractors and consultants to stop the building being wrapped in materials that easily caught fire. Questions are now being asked about the effect of the coalition government¡¦s attempts to deregulate construction ¡V as David Cameron put it at the time, to ¡§kill off the health and safety culture for good¡¨.There were losses to the world of architecture and design: Zeev Aram, the architect and retailer who did much to popularise the work of Eileen Gray; Chris Wilkinson, whose elegant high-tech structures included the Gateshead Millennium Bridge; Virgil Abloh, who took his architectural training into fashion design; the brutalist maestro Owen Luder.

The office workers caught in a sudden blizzard on London¡¦s High Holborn in 1966 illustrate Connolly¡¦s point to varying degrees: the young woman on the left, in particular, seems to have dressed for winter sunshine, only to regret her choices more and more as the day has progressed. She now stands poised on the edge of a street of slush, in lacy tights and leaky shoes, preparing for the arctic expedition back to her desk wearing a beret of sleet. She may be some time.A new book, London in the Snow, features several comparable wardrobe errors. Whiteouts are such infrequent events in the capital that they invariably catch a reasonable haul of high heels and shirt sleeves. The book takes in images of the black-and-white decades of the last century, from the years in which the Thames still froze over to the centrally heated 1970s, when the city centre rarely dropped below freezing (there were 116 snow days in London in the 1950s, compared with 36 in the last decade of the 20th century).In the earlier pictures there are shades of those Dickensian scenes that remain a staple of lamplit Christmas cards (scenes that were already, in Victorian times, nostalgic relics of the ¡§little ice age¡¨ of the author¡¦s childhood). Children lining up for a turn on icy slides across playgrounds; pipe-smoking dads tobogganing in tweed and gaberdine; chestnuts roasting on open fires; schoolboys in short trousers with armfuls of snowballs; carollers coated with layers of snow.

              " 'The American artist Wayne Thiebaud, whose luscious, colorful paintings of cakes and San Francisco cityscapes combined sensuousness, nostalgia and a hint of melancholy, has died. He was 101.His death was confirmed in a statement on Sunday by his gallery, Acquavella, which did not say where or when he died.¡§Even at 101 years old, he still spent most days in the studio, driven by, as he described with his characteristic humility, ¡¥this almost neurotic fixation of trying to learn to paint¡¦,¡¨ the statement said.Thiebaud was born in Mesa, Arizona, in 1920 and grew up in Sacramento, California. He started out as an animator for Walt Disney and worked as a poster designer and commercial artist in California and New York before becoming a painter. He also was a longtime professor at the University of California, Davis. He retired in 1991 but continued teaching one class a year.While some took his hot dogs, bakery counters, gum ball machines and candy apples to be examples of pop art, Thiebaud never considered himself to be in the mold of Andy Warhol and did not treat his subjects with the irony pop championed.¡§Of course, you¡¦re thankful when anyone ever calls you anything,¡¨ he said. ¡§But I never felt much a part of it. I must say I never really liked pop art very much.¡¨The real subject, many critics said, was paint and the act of painting itself: the shimmering color and sensuous texture of thickly applied paint. He laid on paint so heavily that he often carved his signature instead of putting it on with the brush.¡§The oil paint is made to look like meringue,¡¨ said Marla Prather, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York who helped organize a 2001 retrospective. ¡§And with the cakes, you get this great sense of texture with the frosting. You just want to step close and lick it.¡¨Many of Thiebaud¡¦s images were outlined in neon pinks and blues that made the objects appear to glow. Shadows were often a rich blue.¡§It¡¦s joyful, while a lot of modern art is angst-ridden,¡¨ Prather said in 2001.Thiebaud told PBS¡¦ NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in 2000 the subject of food was ¡§fun and humorous, and that¡¦s dangerous in the art world, I think.¡§It¡¦s a world that takes itself very seriously, and of course, it is a serious enterprise, but I think also there¡¦s room for wit and humor because humor gives us, I think, a sense of perspective.¡¨Gum ball machines were a favorite theme, he said, because ¡§a big round globe is so beautiful, and it¡¦s really a kind of orchestration of circles of all kinds. But it¡¦s also very sensuous, I think, and it offers wonderful opportunities for painting something like, almost like a bouquet of flowers.¡¨In 2004, a New York Times writer praised Thiebaud¡¦s ¡§wry vision of modern consumerism¡¨ and said: ¡§No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products.¡¨Thiebaud told PBS he preferred calling himself a painter, rather than an artist, because ¡§it¡¦s like a priest referring to himself as a saint. Maybe it¡¦s a little too early or he¡¦s not the one to decide that ¡K Being an artist I think is a very rare thing.¡¨Along with the sensuousness, there was sometimes an emptiness and melancholy reminiscent of Edward Hopper. He likened the feeling to the ¡§bright pathos¡¨ of a circus clown.In landscape, his most famous subject was San Francisco, whose steep hills he portrayed in a fantasy like way, with spectacular angles and stark shadows.¡§Originally, I painted right on the streets, trying to get some of the kind of drama I felt about the city and its vertiginous (dizzying) character,¡¨ he told PBS.¡§But that didn¡¦t seem to work ¡K The reality was one thing but the fantasy or the exploration of it was another.¡¨',\n",
              " 'A funeral for Covid victims, MumbaiDivyakant Solanki/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock23 April I was staying on the outskirts of Mumbai when news broke that there was a fire in one of the hospitals dealing with Covid patients. I rushed over to find them shifting patients to other hospitals; they said more than 10 people had died already as a result.The funeral was devastating. There were 10 to 12 Covid victims laid out on the funeral pyre with their relatives gathered around, many of them in tears. Dealing with the emotions of relatives and loved ones is the most difficult part of covering events as a photojournalist.Civic workers, such as the man in this photo, had a very important role in funerals during Covid ¡V they were the only people allowed to issue last rites. Sadly, there wasn¡¦t nearly enough PPE for relatives to be able to enter the funeral ground or touch the bodies of their dead family members.This photo is very close to my heart; I have seen so many dead bodies over the past year, but it is difficult to capture the impact that has had on me, let alone the people who have lost relatives. I think seeing a man in PPE, sombrely walking between funeral pyres, shows the human toll of the pandemic. As told to Alex MistlinTunisian people wait for help on a wooden boat, Lampedusa, ItalySanti Palacios/AP25 July We were sailing in international waters just south of the island of Lampedusa when we heard fishers calling through the radio, saying there was this small boat with 17 people in it that was taking on water and desperate for help.The most difficult thing about working at sea is having to work around the rescue operation. The sea route connecting Libya to Italy is one of the deadliest migrant routes in the world. You are in the middle of nowhere, which can be very challenging, especially at night. But when you are lucky and have enough light, or a full moon, you really get the chance to show how lonely the crossings are.I worry that it is not always apparent how extreme these situations are. People have already seen pictures of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean; everyone knows that it is going on. So, the goal is to take pictures that better convey the intensity of their experiences. AMKim Kardashian at the Met Gala, New YorkJustin Lane/EPA13 September I have been covering the Met Gala for a number of years. It is always a bizarre scene. Any red carpet is exciting, but it is such a weird mix of people: businesspeople, music stars, movie stars. There is a frenetic quality to the whole thing that means you can get two completely random celebrities standing next to each other.This is a funny picture, in some ways. To have somebody show up in this outfit, totally covered in black ¡V it shows how celebrity is at a weird juncture. Of course, there are plenty of bizarre outfits at the Met Gala ¡V there is a long procession of crazy outfits and celebrities trying to one-up one another ¡V but being covered in black was so different that it caught my attention. Something really wacky, or really sexy, is almost more mundane.Kim Kardashian is always of great interest to people. It is so much about what she has decided to do in that moment. AMA house covered by ash on La Palma in the Canary Islands, SpainEmilio Morenatti/AP30 October The first time I went to La Palma to cover the eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, the exclusion zone was protected by police, which meant I wasn¡¦t able to get close enough. This was taken on my second trip. I spotted a house on the horizon that was completely covered in ash. My first aim was just to go there on foot, but it wasn¡¦t possible, because of the hot rocks and stones rolling down from the volcano. It can be really impersonal using a drone, but sometimes it is the only option ¡V the only way of capturing the magnitude of the tragedy.The volcano continued to emit vast amounts of magma and ash for more than a month after the eruption. I saw a lot of houses covered completely, but this one was the most visually affecting, because the house is so isolated. It is such a clean snapshot of the devastation the volcano caused. The house is still standing, though. AMA nun pleads with the police in Myitkyina, MyanmarMyitkyina News Journal/AFP/Getty Images8 March Having been the de facto leader of Myanmar since winning a landslide election in November 2015 and assuming the role of state counsellor in April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was deposed in a military coup on 1 February. In the resulting protests, hundreds of people ¡V including dozens of children ¡V were killed by the security forces. This shot, by an unattributed photographer, shows a nun in the northern city of Myitkyina remonstrating with police officers amid the crackdown.An Indonesian burial team in Yogyakarta, JavaUlet Ifansasti/Getty Images12 August In July and August, Indonesia was really struggling to contain its Covid outbreak. I had the idea of photographing a burial team to show how Covid protocols were affecting every aspect of life in Indonesia. Yogyakarta was particularly badly hit by the Delta variant; you would hear ambulance sirens everywhere you went and the burial teams were at the frontline. It is them who have to deal with the situation when people go into hospital and don¡¦t come out alive.I was at a hospital when, at about 11pm, I got the call to put on my hazmat suit and head to the cemetery. Covid protocols meant that people had to be distant from their family in their final moments. It was so sad seeing the families praying outside the cemeteries, knowing that their loved one¡¦s burial was being left to a team of strangers in hazmat suits. AMTom Daley knits before the men¡¦s 10m platform final at the Olympics, TokyoClive Rose/Getty Images7 August I have been photographing Tom since Beijing 2008. He is a joy to photograph.This was just before his 10m Olympic final. With the Covid protocols, there wasn¡¦t enough time to go back and chill in the Olympic village, so he just found a quiet corner of the swimming pool, practically under the diving board, and got his knitting kit out.Him not having his shirt on adds a nice touch, because of the contrast between his masculinity ¡V his washboard abs and athlete¡¦s physique ¡V and how relaxed he looks, knitting away. I just thought it was a nice moment, not necessarily for now, but to look back on in 20 or 30 years¡¦ time.It was quite a strange Olympics, because of Covid, but for an athlete to start knitting in the middle of an Olympic competition was truly unique. It is very much in keeping with who he is, which is cool. Looking back, people probably remember the whole knitting thing better than him winning his medals. AMA mob attempts to breach the US Capitol, Washington DCVictor J Blue/Bloomberg6 January I had covered a series of large rallies in DC around Trump¡¦s Stop the Steal campaign. By 6 January, we were all prepared for violence around the city, mainly from far right or fascist groups, but anyone who says they knew what was going to happen is a liar.Trump came on stage to the adulation of the crowd, but after 10 or 15 minutes people began peeling away and marching up Pennsylvania Avenue. Maybe they had just heard it all before, but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to be at the front of that group.This picture was taken towards the end of the riot, just after they had breached Congress. I had already been inside with the rioters and was very close to the killing of Ashli Babbitt by a Capitol police officer.The US Congress is a huge building and there were maybe 2,000 protesters trying to breach a set of wooden doors and re-enter the building. Police units inside the building had run out of the chemical irritant they use for crowd control and had resorted to spraying fire extinguishers out the doors. That was when one protester stood at the entrance, spreading his arms in triumph, almost as if to celebrate Trump¡¦s victory in that moment. AMPolice detain a woman as people gather after the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard, Clapham Common, LondonHannah McKay/Reuters13 March Sometimes London can lack a community feel ¡V you don¡¦t know your neighbours ¡V so seeing so many people, particularly young women, come out for this woman whom none of them knew really added to the sense of emotion on the day. There was a lot of crying.There was a small group of protesters addressing hundreds of people from the bandstand. As it was still during Covid restrictions, the police eventually arrived to end the gathering, but many were determined to continue paying their respects. It went from a reflective, emotional scene to an angry one. That was when the police and protesters clashed.I was in the centre of the bandstand when the police began arresting protesters. There was a commotion and I have no idea how Patsy Stevenson came to be forced to the ground, but I have pictures of her on the floor, face down with her hands behind her back.People have said it looks like a painting ¡V she looks so striking with her pale skin and red hair ¡V but it was pitch black and I couldn¡¦t use flash because of the police hi-vis jackets. There is all sorts of luck involved in the elements coming together in this image.I think the picture of a lone female protester being restrained by faceless male police officers helped to propel the story into a talking point; it became a symbol of anger. AMA fisher feeds whale sharks in Tan-Awan, the PhilippinesHannah Reyes Morales/The New York Times/Eyevine30 September I thought it was really interesting to explore how lockdown measures were affecting the relationship between Tan-Awan, a town in the Philippines, and a species in decline.Living in the Philippines, you often witness the tension between wildlife conservation and local communities. Feeding the whale sharks has an impact on their nutrition and migration patterns, while the sharks have abrasions from swimming too close to the boats. But the chance to swim with the world¡¦s biggest fish draws tourists to the town. These fishers wouldn¡¦t be doing this if they had more promising economic opportunities, so I don¡¦t believe in making villains of the community for this practice.I was swimming with the camera, positioning it above and below the water and photographing as widely as I could. To get the entire shark, you have to be quite far away, but not so far that you sacrifice visibility. I find underwater photography challenging ¡V the world is so different beneath the surface. It was important to me to have the shark and the sea warden in the same frame, as this photo is really about a complex interdependence. AMTourists watch a volcano erupt, IcelandArnar Kristjansson9 April This was taken just as the second crater started to form. Earlier in the day, I was caught in a massive snowstorm and I was worried there would be no way to capture it on film. But I decided to wait around just in case the snow cleared; you can never trust the forecast in Iceland.It was weird seeing people standing so close. It can be very dangerous, mainly because of the gas, rather than the lava ¡V if the wind changes direction, then people can get violently ill. There was a teenager taking TikTok videos of himself jumping fewer than five metres away. It was one of those pinch-yourself moments where you capture something truly surreal.The crater you can see in this photo died within a few days, but some of the others formed from this eruption lasted for months. The one here is the most photogenic, however. I think it is really quite beautiful. AMThe last moments of an orphaned mountain gorilla, Virunga national park, Democratic Republic of the CongoBrent Stirton/Getty Images21 September I have worked with those gorillas for quite a long time. I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2007, doing a story on how a group of rangers had gone to South Africa for paramilitary training, to combat the various militia groups that were operating in that park. Three days into that assignment, we heard that a group of severely endangered mountain gorillas had been killed. Since then, I have been returning to the park on a regular basis.In September, I was focused on documenting an operation to clear a group of militias out of the park. While I was there, Ndakasi wasn¡¦t doing well. I went to cover a medical procedure they were doing with her. When she came out of anaesthesia, her caregiver, Andre Bauma, and two vets worked to resuscitate her. After that, she was very weak and crawled on top of Andre. Every part of her was on top of him, the same way a baby would. It was very childlike. The park knew she was very sick, but was hoping she would recover. Then things took a turn.It was very sombre. Once it was clear what was happening, I shot these frames and left, because it became a very personal moment between her and Andre. She was the only gorilla to survive that massacre in 2007. She was a baby and was found suckling her dead mother. It was very cold and babies can die of exposure very quickly. On that day, Andre became her caregiver. The story is he put her inside his shirt for warmth and walked about four miles through a dangerous area. There is a certain cycle to how she died, being close to him, being held by him again. As told to Emine SanerA girl in her destroyed home, GazaFatima Shbair/Getty Images24 May I was on assignment for Getty Images that day to cover Gaza after the Gaza-Israel ceasefire agreement. I headed straight to Beit Hanoun ¡V the neighbourhood had been hit while families were in their homes.I visited all the families there, heard their stories and went inside the destroyed houses, including the home of Raghad Naseer. Raghad accompanied me from one room to another, carrying her teddy bear. I asked Raghad about her room and she took me to it.She was quiet the whole time, with signs of shock and sadness on her face. She stood in her room in complete silence, contemplating what had happened to the neighbourhood through the destroyed wall, as if she could not comprehend it. Seeing Raghad in this state was very painful. In this picture, she was expressing the feelings of all the residents of the neighbourhood. It sums up everything that happened.I visited Raghad again this month. She and her family had to leave the neighbourhood and rent a small house far away. Raghad and her siblings suffer psychologically from what happened; they feel very upset at losing their home and being separated from their neighbours. Taking this picture made me think: my home could have been like this at any moment and I would have lived with the same feeling. I look at the people in Beit Hanoun and think how strong they are. ESTaliban fighters at Hamid Karzai International airport recite evening prayers, KabulJim Huylebroek/The New York Times/Eyevine28 August This was taken a couple of weeks after the fall of Kabul. Outside the airport, it was complete chaos; it felt like everyone in the country was trying to get in. Just a couple of days prior, the Islamic State offshoot ISKP attack had killed hundreds.These men are special forces who have been deployed to secure the airport. It was very difficult getting access and, on my previous attempts, I had either been turned away or beaten. That day, I was determined to get in. When night fell, I made my way inside, before explaining to a group of Taliban fighters that I just needed a few photos of them inside the gate.One guy, the man you can see leading the prayers, started speaking English; he said I might be able to take some after prayers. I asked if I could take them during. Seeing the fighters praying with their modern military equipment, uniforms and helmets seemed like a good encapsulation of how the Taliban had transitioned from a guerrilla force to a modern military operation.This image is important to me personally, because it vindicated my decision to stay through August. It was a gamble, because we knew things would be uncertain once the Taliban took over, but I felt I had to be there to document the end of the global war on terror as we know it. AMRevellers at Bushwig, a drag extravaganza, New YorkStephanie Keith/Reuters12 September I attended the first Bushwig 10 years ago and was taken aback; it was freer, more avant garde, than anything I had seen previously. Since then, it has become probably the biggest drag festival in the world, with hundreds of performers over two days. It is a must-do event in New York City queer nightlife.That is Amanda Lepore. She is quite the character, more icon than woman at this point. When she steps on the stage, everyone just flips out ¡V girls, boys, straight, gay. She stands for everything that is important about drag: embracing yourself and having the ability to be whoever you want to be. AMA refugee is comforted by a member of the Spanish Red Cross, Ceuta, SpainBernat Armangue/AP18 May This was taken in Ceuta, one of two Spanish exclaves bordering Morocco on Africa¡¦s Mediterranean coast. Given that politically it is in Europe, it is a long-established route into the continent. On 17 and 18 May, more than 8,000 people crossed over.This man arrived with his brother, who fell unconscious. He started freaking out, scared that his companion was dying. A member of the Red Cross consoled him, saying everything was going to be OK. It was just one of those moments; he had no choice but to collapse, not only because of the traumatic situation, but also, I imagine, because of the weight of everything they had been through in the previous few weeks.A lot of the time, arriving migrants do not receive the help or attention they need ¡V it was so great to capture a moment of genuine connection between two human beings, independent of their backgrounds or religions. AMA horse being airlifted by the Swiss military, Saignel?gierFabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images9 April I was told the Swiss army veterinary service were carrying out tests and there were rumours that this would feature horses being airlifted by helicopter. I had no idea how that was going to work, but I suspected it might make for a nice picture.The horses are tranquillised and have their face covered before being attached to the helicopter. Their bodies are wrapped, too, as it gets quite cold up there.I couldn¡¦t include the helicopter in the shot, as the cable was too long ¡V almost 30 metres ¡V but I think it gives the photograph a surreal air, just seeing a horse suspended like that. It is a very strange image. I think it is improved by not having the context of the helicopter.The horses are carried over quite long distances, often for more than half an hour. What I really like about this picture is that you can see the movement of the horse ¡V you can almost feel it swinging in the wind. AMResidents evacuate an island hit by wildfires, Evia, GreeceKonstantinos Tsakalidis/Bloomberg via Getty Images8 August As soon as I reached the island of Evia, I could see the fires raging in the distance, rising above the sky and burning with this awe-inspiring intensity. You could hear this terrifying crackling sound across the island; it was unlike anything I had ever experienced.I saw Panayiota Noumidi, 81, moving awkwardly outside the house you can see here. She was clearly distressed, so I approached her. She said she couldn¡¦t find her husband (they were later reunited) and that she was fearful for her home ¡V they had built it slowly over 20 years and it looked like the flames were heading straight towards it (it was not damaged).It was a chaotic day, but I tried my best to capture the intensity of the fire, the desperation of people in Evia and the lack of government help for those in distress.I knew straight away the picture was an important reflection of the situation facing Greek people. But I couldn¡¦t imagine it would go viral around the world. It has come to symbolise the climate crisis, with the catastrophic damage caused by the fires representing the damage that human activity is doing to the planet. For me, it is very special to take a photo that affects so many people around the world. AMDenmark footballers form a human shield around their teammate Christian Eriksen at Euro 2020, CopenhagenFriedemann Vogel/EPA12 June This was taken roughly four or five minutes after Eriksen collapsed. At the moment I took this, no one knew if he was even alive.I tried to maintain distance throughout. Uefa¡¦s Covid rules prevented me from going on to the pitch, but, regardless, I felt it was important not to do anything that might interfere with the medical team¡¦s work.I got a lot of criticism for this picture, for trying to get a shot of someone who was potentially dead, but it is my job. It is really important to show the reality of the situation. Seeing the fans hoping and praying was so powerful. Regardless of nationality or support, everyone just wanted Eriksen to be OK.The faces of the players around Eriksen are unbelievable. They can clearly see how serious the situation is and they are extremely distressed. Restarting someone¡¦s heart is incredibly difficult; when you see it up close, as I could, you realise how much every moment matters. AMPeople feed seagulls in the smog, DelhiNavesh Chitrakar/Reuters18 November From the moment I arrived in Delhi, my eyes burned from the thick smog. I wasn¡¦t there for work; it was more of a holiday, with my wife, so I took the opportunity to spend a few days waking up early and getting out to take pictures. After I came back from the shoot, I went through all the pictures and almost didn¡¦t bother to file this one. But I asked my wife: ¡§Which picture should I go with?¡¨ and this one was her selection. The initial story was about the pollution, but for me this picture is all about the birds; they look so dramatic against the smog-filled backdrop.',\n",
              " 'My friend Brian Barnes, who has died aged 77 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was a celebrated muralist and a leading light in the community arts movement. Warm-hearted, funny, outspoken and a hugely gifted artist, he created murals around south London for more than 45 years.He was born in Farnborough, Kent, and raised in nearby St Paul¡¦s Cray, the first child of William Barnes, chief executive of the Mullard electrical components company, and his wife, Eileen (nee Hiley), a seamstress at Morphy Richards. His parents supported him in everything and he had a happy childhood. Brian¡¦s first school was Gray¡¦s Farm primary, then Midfield secondary school for boys.He began a course at Ravensbourne College of Art (now Ravensbourne University London) in 1961, leading to a national diploma in design. There he met Aileen McKeegan, studying fabric design, and they married in 1964. Brian stood out as a determined realist painter and went on to study at the Royal College of Art, where he graduated in 1969 with beautifully composed and detailed work.Moving to Battersea, south-west London, the couple found a leftwing group of friends and became activists, campaigning for better social provision in housing, parks and jobs and protesting against rent rises and the redevelopment of Battersea power station and the riverfront for the wealthy.The necessity of creating art expressing social concerns gave Brian a new direction, and a bolder style for his work. In 1973 he began printing silkscreen posters at home for campaigns. Demand grew and by 1977 his print workshop was producing hundreds of posters for the community.Then came the murals. His first, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, in 1975, was vast, and was painted with 90 volunteers, near Battersea Bridge. On the ¡§good¡¨ end were pictures of socialist goals, in the centre a ¡§rainbow¡¨ broom swept away the capitalists¡¦ failure. It became a popular landmark. A year later the wall was demolished. Protesters arrived in thousands, Battersea Bridge was closed and the artist arrested.More large scale gable-end murals followed; sunny evocations like Day at the Seaside and Battersea in Perspective. Then anti-war murals: Nuclear Dawn in Brixton, with its threatening skeleton, and Riders of the Apocalypse in New Cross, featuring world leaders riding rockets around a besieged world, above a tender rendering of messages at Greenham Common. There were many more murals for creches, nurseries, schools, towns, estates and railway stations.The Stockwell war memorial, begun in 1999, was the work he returned to often. It is a joyful mural with many images, dedicated to the fallen in the world wars, and celebrating local residents such as Vincent Van Gogh and the second world war special operations agent Violette Szabo, as well as the Windrush immigrants who spent their first night in Britain in the area.Brian was appointed MBE in 2005 for services to the Battersea community. He is survived by Aileen and their children, Eloise and Glenn, and grandchildren Daniel, Lilya and Natalya.',\n",

Featuring more than 15 works, can this really be the first ever show dedicated to his self-portraits, from every stage of his career? AS Courtauld Gallery, London, 3 February-8 MayOne of the most mysterious wonders of archaeology gets the blockbuster treatment. From the medieval myth that Merlin imported it from Ireland by magic to great artistic images by Blake and Constable, to the arrest of Hardy¡¦s Tess of the d¡¦Urbervilles at the stones, this ancient place haunts British culture. JJ British Museum, London, 17 February-17 JulyThe studio as workshop, factory, sanctuary and theatre, and both subject and artwork in its own right. Taking us from Francis Bacon¡¦s photogenic chaos to a Louise Bourgeois cell, from collective, collaborative spaces to places where creativity has run out, this exhibition reveals a century of art-making and aeons of frittered time. AS Whitechapel Gallery, London, 17 February-29 MayIt has long been Ikon director Jonathan Watkins¡¦s dream to stage a show of Italian Renaissance painter Carlo Crivelli (1435-95), who was both a conservative figure and, Watkins says, ¡§as radical as Magritte¡¨. Susan Sontag saw Crivelli as ¡§camp¡¨. Curiosity piqued at Crivelli¡¦s undoubted weirdness, I can¡¦t wait. AS Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 23 February-29 MayThe surrealist belief that beauty comes from the unconscious was born in Paris but kindled dreams around the globe. In Prague, it unleashed the visions of novelist Bohumil Hraba and animator Jan ?vankmajer. In Mexico it inspired Frida Kahlo. Follow its flame to these and many more surreal breeding grounds. JJ Tate Modern, London, 24 February-29 AugustAll you need is love, and in the case of this pop artist who died in 2018 that¡¦s all a lot of us know about him. Indiana¡¦s defining work Love is a public sculpture that swept the world, but how did he develop? Here¡¦s a chance to see him whole. JJ Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 12 March-8 January 2023The 19th-century painter Kawanabe Ky?sai brought Japanese art into modern times. He lived in an age of widening encounters for Japan and was a contemporary of the French impressionists, dying in 1889. His ghosts, courtesans and animals are rollicking masterpieces. This show from a great collection reveals a genius. JJ Royal Academy, London, 19 March-19 JuneUnpicking British colonial history is key to the work of the Guyanese-British artist, whose Armada, a flotilla of 45 votive boats, will be suspended from the ceiling of Tate Liverpool in February. Locke¡¦s forthcoming commission for Tate Britain¡¦s Duveen Galleries combines the themes and material that have informed his earlier work: expect trophies from the junkyard of empire, remnants and flotsam and flowers. AS Tate Britain, London, 22 March-23 OctoberThe Hepworth¡¦s delayed show by the Paris-based American artist, who has used weaving as the basis of her work for more than 50 years, finally arrives. Drawing on wildly different weaving traditions, and working on both small woven drawings and large-scale installations that respond to the architecture of the gallery, the exhibition promises to be ravishing. A perfect venue for her art. AS Hepworth Wakefield, 7 April-25 SeptemberA great premise ¡V get three leading artists to each nominate a younger colleague, who gets 25,000 and a show at Baltic. Culture and nature, cosmological thinking and the political and material formation of taste inform the work of Ima-Abasi Okon, Laleh Khorramian and Fernando Garc?a-Dory, selected by Otobong Nkanga, Mika Rottenberg and Hito Steyerl. AS Baltic Gateshead, 9 April-2 OctoberGonzalez-Foerster is an enigmatic creator of rooms, situations and beguiling surprises. Speculative, literary, haunting and strange, the French artist¡¦s work is often as autobiographical as it is a kind of sci-fi of the self and our place in the universe. The Serpentine tells us to expect ¡§an immersive, supernatural and sensory environment¡¨: I haven¡¦t a clue what to expect. AS Serpentine Gallery, London, 13 April-4 September (Dates TBC)Surrealism still lives in the transformations Parker performs on everyday stuff. Her often comical, accidental-on-purpose catastrophes, from blowing up a shed to crushing musical instruments to flattening the silverware, have helped make contemporary art popular. So this retrospective with all her greatest hits should go down a treat. JJ Tate Britain, London, 18 May-16 OctoberPicasso gobbled up artistic influences from around the world but was also able to take on European classicism. After all, he was trained in it at a 19th-century academy. This should be thrilling as we see how he squared up to the authority of Ingres with great, strange results. JJ National Gallery, London, 3 June-9 OctoberWorking for more than 40 years as a domestic nanny in suburban Chicago, Vivian Maier had a double life as a street photographer. Her anonymity was her disguise but it was taken to such an extreme that her art remained almost unknown until after her death. Maier saw herself as a sort of spy, recording life in Chicago, New York and wherever her obligations took her. She was brilliant, weird and wonderful. AS MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, 11 June-25 SeptemberThe first survey of American artist Carolee Schneemann¡¦s (1939-2019) work in the UK, the show celebrates a radical artist and feminist agent-provocateur. Tracing her development from early paintings and assemblage, to her confrontational performances using her body as primary medium and subject, and her later films and multimedia installations. AS Barbican Art Gallery, London, 8 September-8 January 2023The recently discovered erotic drawings of Bloomsbury artist Duncan Grant should bring the crowds to this house and gallery that preserves the spirit of the early 20th-century avant garde. Grant¡¦s openly gay sex scenes were made at a time when homosexuality was a crime. They are his masterpieces. JJ Charleston, Sussex, 17 September -12 March 2023Artists Monster Chetwynd and Ryan Gander are among the stars of a cultural festival across the north-east to celebrate the return of a regional wonder. The illuminated Saxon treasure the Lindisfarne Gospels, created by Northumbrian monks, is one of the most hauntingly beautiful manuscripts on Earth. And it¡¦s coming home. JJ Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, 17 September-3 December (plus region-wide events)In a year that also includes its much-delayed Raphael blockbuster, the National Gallery dives into the world of a modern great. Freud belongs here. He judged himself against the likes of Titian, Rubens and Corot ¡V and now his paintings can be assessed in their company. A genius takes his place in history. JJ National Gallery, London, 1 October-22 January 2023C?zanne remains a pivotal figure in the development of modern art. Reclusive, idealistic and curmudgeonly, this new retrospective will contain many works not seen in the UK before, and follow his development from the 1850s to his death in 1906. It¡¦s not all about apples, mountains or the bucolic Proven?al good life. Tate last mounted a C?zanne retrospective in 1996. It feels a world away. AS Tate Modern, London, 6 October-12 March 2023A hole-filled slice of Swiss cheese has landed in Budapest¡¦s wooded City Park, forming an undulating canopy above the trees.

Folkestone, early 2022The postmodern American architect John Hejduk created stories and characters more than buildings, concocting casts of strange anthropomorphic structures that took on lives of their own. This free installation will see a large-scale model constructed from one of his ¡§masques¡¨, built in collaboration with students from the Royal College of Art. Royal Academy, London, 22 MarchAfter almost six years, Glasgow¡¦s cherished venue is set to reopen, following a 68m refurbishment by John McAslan.

              " 'From vaccination centres and ICU wards to family reunions and lockdown beards, the images selected by the Guardian and Observer photographers, accompanied by their thoughts, give individual takes on covering the ongoing pandemic.Graeme RobertsonThe week I spent in the ICU was really shocking for me. I also caught Covid that week so I had time after the job to think about what I had witnessed. I sat in the ward opposite a poor patient and was surprised how pale and plastic their skin appeared. I asked the doctors if this was normal for Covid sufferers; the doctors said the patients were dying and the skin changes colour. This was shocking to me. I thought every person breaking the rules or did not think Covid was that bad should spend a day in this ward. The people were very ill and helpless. I was scared and I don¡¦t get scared. I was also so impressed with the staff and the amount of people needed to achieve very small jobs like moving a patient; it took six to eight people just to turn a patient in bed. I already had so much respect for our NHS staff but now I think they are superhuman and deserve everything we can give them.Murdo MacLeodVaccination has changed our landscape and our lives over the last year. Imagine the world without it. There is no freedom like good health. I photographed on a day when almost 1,000 people of all sorts and sizes got vaccinated in a sports hall at Thurso high school. The team included practice nurses, advanced nurse practitioners, GPs, a retired GP, a trainee GP, paramedics and a consultant physician. Additional volunteers included practice administration staff and even some patients acting as support volunteers. It was the epitome of community and society at work doing good.Richard SakerWith Covid influencing the way I¡¦ve worked this year it was good to get away from this story for a while. So the opportunity to cover moorland burning in a considered way over a few days and listen to the arguments for and against was refreshing and enlightening. To its critics, moorland burning is damaging to the environment ¡V it releases millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases, destroys habitats and increases the threat of flooding in lowland rivers. The vast moorland estates in northern England and Scotland earn vast incomes from grouse-hunting and every year they burn patches of heather to remove cover for predators and create space for green shoots to be eaten by the grouse. The estates argue that the burning helps to preserve the landscape and claim that opposition is motivated by hostility to grouse shooting. I love the Yorkshire Dales, its a special place of peace and tranquillity so to see it ablaze was, as a photographer, visually spectacular and dramatic but as a human being left me feeling upset and worried. Looking at this image makes me feel uneasy and if it makes others feel the same way then it was certainly a photograph worth taking.Sarah LeeThis was an impromptu shot. I happened to be cycling past Buckingham Palace on the afternoon Prince Philip¡¦s death had been announced. People and news cameras were gathering in the expectation of seeing ¡§something¡¨, ¡§anything¡¨. There was the feel of a strange pandemic-influenced spectacle. Genuine mourners (and there were a few quietly dignified people laying flowers who had known or worked personally with the duke) were outnumbered by curious members of the public. It still felt odd to see people shoulder to shoulder in a crowd. We were only just coming out of the strictest stage of last winter¡¦s lockdown. You could palpably sense the nervousness about Covid. But also the thrill of being in a crowd again. Part of a collective experience, albeit a slightly melancholy one, for the first time in months. As I watched, this ardent royalist dressed in his ramshackle homemade guards uniform came to leave a tribute. It caused the crowd to surge together. A strange site of curious masked spectators watching a self-consciously public display of mourning that seemed so specific to these weird pandemic times.Martin GodwinThe Covid memorial is a public mural painted by volunteers to commemorate victims of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Stretching for more than a third of a mile along the South Bank of the River Thames in London, opposite the Palace of Westminster. As the day was ending, the last of the light caught the wall and it seemed to glow. People turn up to look and maybe draw a red heart. Some just quickly walk past. But most seem to slow and look and read the inscriptions on the wall. The young couple in the photo stopped for some time to take in the memorial, as the woman reached out to touch some heart, or name, the feeling was palpable.Chris ThomondLeo Fielding caught my eye immediately as he strode up the nave at Lichfield Cathedral, which had opened that day as a coronavirus vaccination hub.Smartly dressed and full of purpose, the energetic octogenarian quickly took a seat and rolled up his shirt sleeve. As Sister Elaine Stokes inverted the vial and carefully filled the syringe, he took in every last detail as if to savour the moment. His gaze never wavered as she checked for air bubbles and then approached, needle in hand. Within seconds the task was complete and one of the NHS¡¦s heroes exchanged mask-hidden smiles and wished Leo well as he stood up to head home.Interrupting his walk towards the exit, I remarked that it was a wonderful setting for such a momentous personal occasion. He glanced around at the magnificent surroundings and whispered: ¡§Yes, I think I¡¦ll say a little prayer of thanks on my way out.¡¨After spending the previous year photographing too many Covid hotspots, this was easily the most uplifting experience I¡¦d witnessed. Many were nervously stepping outside their doors for the first time since the pandemic started, eager to be filled with a miraculous new drug and hope for the future.David LeveneI caught Covid, along with the rest of my family, just before Christmas last year. Thankfully our illnesses were not too severe and I was back to work by 2 January 2021. Five days later, I was witnessing, first-hand, just how severely many other people were being affected by the disease on the Covid wards at Milton Keynes hospital.Until then it had been difficult to get media access to Covid wards, but by the second wave, hospitals had begun to let journalists document the increasingly bleak picture that faced NHS staff as they battled to deal with rising infections and severe illness, largely due to the more transmissible Alpha variant. I spent the day in Milton Keynes meeting staff and patients on high-dependency and intensive care units. Nine out of the 10 beds in the ICU were occupied by patients seriously ill with Covid-19, most of whom were unconscious.The man in this photograph had been admitted two days earlier and, like the rest of the patients suffering with Covid-19, was alone, separated from family members not allowed into the hospital to be with their loved ones. I watched as nurse Kim James comforted the patient, holding his hand tightly as he struggled to breathe, assisted by the Cpap (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) mask he wore over his face.The patient died from Covid-19 two days later.Antonio OlmosOn a Monday morning in May I got a call from Kate Edwards, the picture editor of the Guardian Weekend Magazine. She wanted to know if I could do a studio photo illustration for a piece on sex during the Covid pandemic. The magazine wanted a mask over a man¡¦s genitals. And could I find a model and do the photo in two days. I said sure, why not. I called a friend who knew lots of men willing to pose naked after all my friends with nice torsos turned me down. My friend found me Dan de la Motte. After two years of covering all the sadness of Covid with empty city streets, closed shops, masked people and those cut down by the disease, this photo is certainly different and was actually fun to do.Jill MeadI¡¦d been out photographing in the West End and was heading home. I saw Alice applying her makeup in the light of a shop window and instantly knew I¡¦d love to take her portrait. She was completely unaware how beautiful and striking she looked and utterly modest too.Alice is 21 years old, a zoology graduate, and in January is heading to a research project in South Africa. She was accepted two years ago but Covid-19 scuppered it. It looked likely that the Omicron variant would jeopardise her trip again but she¡¦s finally going. She can¡¦t wait. I felt so thrilled for her and truly chuffed that I¡¦d captured a tiny aspect of her adventure, with the Oxford Street Christmas lights, as a lovely backdrop. Everything about meeting her felt optimistic. I¡¦d missed that feeling.Suki DhandaI shot a series of photographs focusing on men and boys growing their hair during lockdown earlier this year. Although the salons had reopened from 12 April 2021, for some there was no rush for a cut. Most liked the longer unkempt look. What was the point of a haircut if there was nowhere to go?In this photo, Josh is sitting next to his brother-in-law, Arun. Both spent their lockdown in his mother-in-law¡¦s house in Slough. I had not met them before. Not only did they have matching long hair and beards, but they also dressed similarly. Both were very happy with their hair ¡V much to the dismay of their family ¡V and were planning to keep their hair uncut. Four months later Josh did end up trimming  his hair and beard to look smarter for work. Aaron ended up shaving his head and his hair has grown back to a manageable length, so far!Linda NylindAt the beginning of the winter lockdown in January 2021, I took a series of pictures for my lockdown diary to visualise my feelings about the pandemic. I stumbled upon this shuttered boutique full of wedding dresses on Fonthill Road in Finsbury Park, an area normally buzzing with fashion traders and people buying outfits for special occasions. In normal times, this shop front would have represented the most joyous moment in many people¡¦s lives, but it had somehow taken on an apocalyptic air. It made me think about all the lives disrupted, dreams shattered, and plans put on hold indefinitely because of the pandemic.Tristram KentonThe RSC¡¦s Comedy of Errors, directed by Phillip Breen, was due to open in the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in April 2020. Because of lockdown restrictions, all their theatres were closed. Sixteen months later, the production opened in a new outdoor performance space, the Lydia and Manfred Gorvy Garden theatre: a space that had not even been conceived of when the production went into rehearsal.I had spent most of that time glued to my desk digitising my archive, so it was exhilarating to be back photographing live theatre again. This wide-angle shot shows the performance in full flow, with the two permanent RSC theatres, the RST and Swan, lit up behind. It shows just how successful the RSC, like many other theatres, has been in adapting to the circumstances, giving audiences (those who were lucky enough to get tickets!) a magical live experience again.Tom JenkinsSpurs v Chelsea, normally one of the most intense matches in the Premier League with a rivalry that borders on hatred among the fans. This was the scene at half-time in their clash at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in early February. It¡¦s taken at the top of the huge South Stand, the biggest single-tiered stand in the country, which, in normal times, would be packed with home fans. That moment felt very dark and haunting as the message to social distance was played out across the rows of empty seats.Fabio de PaolaI did a shoot on the first day of lockdown easing at Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham when members of different households could meet up, play outdoor sports and have picnics again. Walking around the park, I couldn¡¦t help notice a family bring out a cake on to a picnic table. It was Alyssa¡¦s birthday and she was seeing her fiance for the first time in seven months! Double celebration. All the family seems so happy to be meeting up. It felt like a corner had been turned.Jonny WeeksSeldom have I had much freedom or time to play around with my cameras since I was at art school, so when my editor asked me to diarise lockdown life in a creative way during the third national lockdown (January 2021) I wandered out to my local coastline looking for inspiration. The sunlight streaming over the cliffs at Chapel Porth in Cornwall provided a strong backlight for high contrast photography and when I combined these landscape images with pictures of the tumbling ocean, it created a dissonant effect. I particularly enjoyed it whenever dog walkers, cyclists, surfers and runners crept into these scenes because it gave me the chance to compose something a bit more playful. On reflection, I realised those people were seeking escapism from lockdown life, just as I was, and my multiple exposure photographs were a nod to the solitude and uncertainty of that time.',\n",
              " 'Every morning, when Nadeem Iqbal wakes up and walks into his living room, he has a view of a miraculous world first. A crisp oblong of crystal clear water now hangs in the air between two apartment buildings opposite his balcony, a liquid blue block suspended against the sky with the gravity-defying quality of a Magritte painting.This is the Sky Pool, the latest addition to the luxury residential enclave of Embassy Gardens in Nine Elms, south-west London ¡V one absurdist step beyond the private cinema, indoor pool, gym and rooftop lounge bar. It was dismissed as a ¡§crackers¡¨ PR stunt when the plan was unveiled by Irish developer Ballymore in 2015, a fantastical aquarium of captive high net worth individuals for the rest of us to gawp at from far below. Surely it would never materialise. But last week the scaffolding was taken down to reveal a bright blue rectangle hovering against the leaden January skies, 10 storeys up in the air ¡V just outside the 30-metre bomb blast seclusion zone around the new neighbouring US embassy.It has been billed as the world¡¦s first swimming-pool bridge, a dazzling feat of acrylic engineering that will span the 14-metre gap between the two buildings and give residents the feeling of ¡§floating through the air in central London¡¨. But, although he lives in Embassy Gardens, Iqbal and his neighbours will never enjoy the thrill of going for an aerial dip. ¡§We have a front-row seat of the Sky Pool,¡¨ he told me. ¡§But the sad thing for us, living in the shared-ownership building, is that we will never have access to it. It¡¦s only there for us to look at, just like the nice lobby, and all of the other facilities for the residents of the private blocks. Nobody expects these amenities for free, but we¡¦re not even given the choice to pay for them.¡¨For Iqbal to reach his two-bed flat ¡V valued at 800,000, of which he owns a quarter and pays rent on the rest ¡V he must walk past the grand, hotel-style main entrance to the complex, flanked by supercars with personalised number plates, to the back of the development, past construction fences and piles of rubble, to a small door located between ventilation grilles and a bin store, facing on to a railway line. ¡§There¡¦s a reason they¡¦re called ¡¥poor doors¡¦,¡¨ he said. ¡§I grew up in South Africa, in a country that was racially segregated, but in London there is still really bad class segregation. We have a mortgage and we pay our rent, but every day we are made to feel inferior, like the have-nots of Nine Elms.¡¨Stretching across a 230-hectare riverside swath from Vauxhall Cross to Battersea Power Station, straddling the boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth, the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea (VNEB) ¡§opportunity area¡¨ has been trumpeted as the biggest regeneration project in Europe. When Boris Johnson, as mayor of London, launched the plans in 2012, he described it as ¡§the greatest transformational story in the world¡¦s greatest city¡¨, the ¡§final piece in the jigsaw¡¨ of central London. Once a place of low-slung warehouses and logistics depots, it is now a very visible presence on the London skyline. Competing stacks of luxury flats have sprouted along the river, replacing the elm trees that once stood here with a forest of concrete and cladding, a garish collage of mirrored glass, coloured plastic panels and fake bricks.With around 5,000 homes completed over the past five years, and a further 15,000 in the pipeline, it is now possible to get a sense of what kind of place is being created here, what effect the planning policies of the past decade will have in reality. The results so far are not encouraging. Roughly the size of Monaco, the new district has all the makings of a similarly exclusive fiefdom, an international investors¡¦ playground where regular Londoners are pushed to the very edges, or cut out of the picture altogether.The capital is well used to high-rise, high-end totems by now, but VNEB takes the iniquities of the real estate-industrial complex to extremes. It is a place where penthouses with private chapels and running tracks loom above crumbling council estates across the railway line, where scores of flats lie empty, held by secretive shell companies in off-shore tax havens, and where the division between absentee investors and owner-occupiers confined to poor doors could not be more stark. Dogged by allegations of cronyism and gerrymandering, it is the product of politicians in thrall to property developers, driven by a blind faith in the market ¡V even when investors started to realise that they might have bought into a mirage.All along the railway line, running south-west from Vauxhall to Battersea, stand dense rows of apartment blocks similar to Iqbal¡¦s ¡V the ¡§affordable¡¨ components of the luxury developments, shuffled to the back of the plots where land values are lowest, hidden from view along with the garages and service entrances. It is the same story across the road, where the angular blocks of the Riverlight development march along the Thames, along with a shared-ownership building that, for the last few years, has faced on to the noise and dust of the construction site for London¡¦s new ¡§super-sewer¡¨. Brightly coloured vents and glass elevators reveal that this comes from the stable of architects Rogers Stirk Harbour, but the stylistic add-ons do little to disguise the reality of serried slabs of investment units garnished with fenced-off slivers of lawn ¡V where neither pets nor ball games are allowed.Next to Embassy Gardens stands The Residence, by Bellway Homes, offering ¡§elegant Manhattan-style living¡¨ in a series of brick towers jazzed up with gaudy red and yellow panels. A broad staircase leads up from the street to a podium garden, but a tall fence with an electric gate stops the second-class residents from getting in. ¡§We are strategically excluded from being part of the community,¡¨ said Jason Owusu-Frimpong, who lives in part of The Residence facing the railway line, managed by housing association L&Q. ¡§We would happily pay for gym membership, if we were allowed to, but the management says it¡¦s not for us. Meanwhile, the car park they told us was only for disabled use is now being sold off to wealthy international residents.¡¨A few metres from his front door sit a pair of souped-up sports cars with Qatari number plates, parked ostentatiously on the pavement blocking an emergency exit, with a clutch of unpaid parking tickets flapping in the breeze beneath their windscreen wipers. The concierge is exasperated. ¡§They are deliberately doing this,¡¨ said the man behind the desk in the private building¡¦s lobby, to which Owusu-Frimpong and his neighbours are denied entry. ¡§We have sent endless letters to the residents in question, but there¡¦s nothing we can do about it. They come here from the Gulf for a few months of the year in holiday mode, race up and down the road, revving their engines late at night, then they ship their cars back home and never pay the fines.¡¨VNEB is emerging as a place of two communities, with a bitter sense of division nurtured by the very fabric of the neighbourhood. The exclusion has been designed into the buildings, streets and public spaces, and is enforced by the private management regimes that govern them. If it is an opportunity area, it has been an opportunity for trialling a new form of social apartheid on an industrial scale.Andrea Franzel lives in an apartment in the Chancery building of Embassy Gardens, a shared ownership block managed by the Peabody housing association. After months of navigating dense bureaucracy, as chair of the residents¡¦ association, he secured some funding to buy a painting for the building¡¦s bleak communal lobby, along with a mirror and a small console table. But, after three years, Peabody¡¦s neighbourhood manager ruled that the table was a fire hazard, and had it removed. ¡§It sounds like a small thing,¡¨ said Franzel, ¡§but that little table was part of our community. We used to buy fresh flowers and leave things for each other. Now we have nothing.¡¨ Next door, the lobby for the private residents looks like a club-class lounge, teeming with expensive hazards, from the thick-pile carpets to marble coffee tables and inviting sofas. While these residents get packages delivered to their door, Franzel and his neighbours find their parcels often go missing, dumped in a pile downstairs. Since the pandemic struck, only the lift lobbies of the private blocks have been supplied with pumps of hand sanitiser.Residents on both sides have reported a host of issues with the buildings¡¦ construction quality, from broken windows and doors to sinks that weren¡¦t connected to waste pipes when they moved in, leading to serious internal leaks ¡V an ongoing catalogue of calamities reported by a pair of Instagram accounts, @real_embassygardens and @ballymorehell. Private leaseholders are just as furious, leaving online reviews raging about everything from poor workmanship to extortionate service charges and ¡§monopolistic¡¨ energy contracts.A spokesperson for Ballymore says: ¡§We aim to create great places and positive experiences for everyone who lives on our sites. All residents at Embassy Gardens receive the same service in terms of estate management, security, fire command and control, general building safety and energy supply.¡¨ They stress that the affordable housing blocks are managed by Peabody and Optivo, which ¡§had the option to choose which facilities they wanted to buy into for their residents¡¨. As for the construction issues, they say: ¡§We take any issues seriously and have two full-time aftercare managers on site, as well as a construction team completing the final residential building, so any issues can be dealt with swiftly.¡¨Spokespeople for Peabody, Optivo and L&Q all say that it is never their intention to make any community feel excluded, and that their policies do not include access to the private amenities in order to keep the service charges to a minimum. They insist that these terms were made clear to residents at the point of sale. As for being given the option to pay for additional services, such as gym membership, L&Q adds that ¡§following feedback from residents, we are reviewing this approach¡¨.For Ravi Govindia, the Conservative leader of Wandsworth council since 2010, and key proponent of the area¡¦s regeneration, it is a question of choice in a free market. ¡§One shouldn¡¦t create a deliberate division without telling people what their money buys,¡¨ he said. ¡§If people were led to believe they had access to everything, then in the small print it said otherwise, that would be wrong. But it¡¦s up to people to make their choices.¡¨When it comes to the criticism that the area is a ghost town, full of empty flats for foreign investors, not real homes that London needs, Govindia shrugs it off. ¡§London is an international city,¡¨ he said. ¡§It has always had people who don¡¦t live in their home for 365 days a year. And the reality of overseas investment from off-plan sales has, in many cases, delivered these developments.¡¨The district¡¦s supposed popularity with foreign buyers has long been held up as a sign of success, with models of the VNEB developments a regular feature at the Mipim property trade fair in Cannes for the past decade. The primary purpose of the flats as safe deposit boxes, not homes, is evident when you look at the floor plans: this is ¡§investment grade space¡¨, with tiny rooms that just meet the minimum regulatory allowances, and emphasis placed on transport links and proximity to Westminster. So how attractive has this promised land actually proved to be for foreign buyers?Not very, the data suggests ¡V despite everything that estate agents were doing to prove otherwise. In 2016, shortly after many of the projects launched off-plan sales, property analytics firm Propcision observed a strange phenomenon. Hundreds of luxury flats in Battersea and Nine Elms were continually being listed for sale on sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla, then taken down and immediately relisted. It was being done at such frequency across so many developments that it distorted the market across the whole area. ¡§It gave the impression that there was not only a lot of activity,¡¨ said Propcision¡¦s director, Michelle Ricci-Zak, ¡§but that the average price in that area was going up ¡V when actually we proved it was going down.¡¨In one snapshot, looking at an agency that listed 35 new-build properties for sale during an eight-month period, the constant relisting made it look as if there were in fact 368 properties for sale. Rather than roughly 50m in market value of apartments advertised, the distortion would have made it appear as more than 500m. In another example, a 3.6m flat was re-listed 15 times in six months, making it seem like the average asking price in the area was skyrocketing. The manufactured flurry also gave the impression to potential buyers that flats were ¡§flying off the shelves¡¨, she said, when in fact the developers were struggling to offload them. The reality was that they were selling off homes in bulk at steep discounts to corporate landlords and institutional investors, with prices slashed by up to 38%.As off-plan customers began to suspect that they had bought into an illusion, they rushed to sell their speculative investments back to the developers, leading to a phenomenon known as ¡§Nine Elms disease¡¨, as up to 2m was knocked off the price of some penthouse flats. ¡§Battersea panic stations¡¨ announced one headline. While the practice of immediate relisting has now been banned, and prices have mostly stabilised, there are still signs of a glut of too many similar high-end flats, with some investors trying to dispose of entire floors of towers in Vauxhall. ¡§It seems some people took a big bite of the pie,¡¨ said Ricci-Zak, ¡§and it didn¡¦t taste so good.¡¨It was the 180-metre-tall St George Wharf Tower, by the Berkeley Group, which began the craze for what has become a crowd of swollen shafts at this bend in the river. The tower was initially refused permission by Lambeth council, but in 2005 then-secretary of state John Prescott gave it the rubber stamp, despite warnings from his expert advisers that it ¡§could set a precedent for the indiscriminate scattering of very tall buildings across London¡¨. And so it did.As you exit Vauxhall station, the first of the priapic bunch to smack you in the face is the Damac Tower, formerly known as Aykon, designed by KPF architects and developed by Damac Properties ¡V the same firm behind Donald Trump¡¦s golf course resort in Dubai. It was billed as the very pinnacle of luxury living, ¡§a global symbol of opulence¡¨ with a full-length pool on the 23rd floor and all interiors designed by Versace, offering buyers the chance to ¡§live the complete Versace lifestyle, a fantasy turned into reality¡¨. It now stands as a menacing Goliath on the edge of the Vauxhall gyratory, its lumpen blocks smothered with different cladding panels, as if several unrelated buildings have been chopped up and bolted back together without the instructions.Sales launched in 2015, with flats pitched at Mayfair prices, reaching more than 2,000 per square foot ¡V twice as much as neighbouring towers. But the Versace label hasn¡¦t proved as much of a lure to foreign buyers as hoped. Over the past five years, prices for flats in ¡§the ultimate in branded living experience¡¨ have dropped by an average of 20%. ¡§The closer it gets to the completion date of these towers,¡¨ said Ricci-Zak, ¡§the more desperate it seems the contract holders are to get out.¡¨Reaching 170 metres in height, the Damac Tower is part of the so-called ¡§Vauxhall cluster¡¨, a row of towers that now forms a motley wall on the skyline. Separated by roaring six-lane roads, the buildings are actually spaced too far apart to form any kind of cluster, standing with the awkward air of a socially distanced gathering of portly executives in ill-fitting suits.The cumulative effect of such a bloated outcrop was never properly considered. The 2012 planning framework for the area, drawn up by the Greater London Authority with input from Lambeth and Wandsworth, set a maximum height limit of 150 metres, with the taller St George Tower as ¡§the pinnacle of the cluster¡¨. But the plan was soon breached with the arrival of One Nine Elms, an apartment and hotel complex rising up to 200 metres, also designed by KPF. In a promotional video the architects argued that their site was at the geographic centre of the future crop, so it should therefore be the tallest, with lesser towers stepping up to it ¡§in a sort of swirl¡¨. The planners were convinced. ¡§The man in the street might not understand how it works,¡¨ said Govindia, ¡§but it is a well-tested principle that you organise tall buildings in a tight cluster, ascending to a peak.¡¨ KPF declined to comment, and their video has now been taken down.What this picturesque notion failed to foresee is that, once one 200-metre tower had been given permission, it would encourage others to follow, with the threat of expensive legal action if refused. It was a repeat of Prescott¡¦s St George Tower fiasco, setting a precedent for neighbouring landowners to inflate their plans.A proposal for a pair of towers by Zaha Hadid Architects on the site of Vauxhall bus station, backed by one of Saudi Arabia¡¦s wealthiest families through a Guernsey-listed company, was cranked up several stories to 185 metres, and given permission by secretary of state Robert Jenrick last year. A gargantuan trio of ziggurat-shaped towers reaching 200 metres is now well underway nearby, set to be the crowning feature of One Thames City, a complex of 12 blocks by Chinese developer R&F Group on the site of the former New Covent Garden flower market (since relocated to a temporary shed down the road while a permanent home is developed). Designed by US firm SOM, it has been pitched as ¡§a new benchmark in enduring luxury¡¨, complete with a 30-metre pool and cigar bar, as well as a landscaped Chinese garden, described as ¡§undoubtedly one of the most fascinating sceneries the Thames will behold¡¨. The construction hoarding shows how the penthouse terraces will even come with their own private infinity pools looking out over the river ¡V a vision recently adorned with a protest sticker with the words: ¡§MAKE THE RICH PAY FOR COVID-19¡¨.Not all Chinese buyers are impressed. ¡§If you buy prime property in London,¡¨ said Ling Zhang, a Chinese investor who has acquired a handful of new-build apartments in the capital in recent years, ¡§you want it to feel like London ¡V not China. I also think there are far too many identical ¡¥luxury¡¦ apartments being built in the same location for it to be a good investment. Chinese buyers are very concerned about location, and we mostly prefer north of the river, close to the universities. Many people send their children to London to study, then rent out the apartments when they graduate.¡¨ Henry Pryor, a prime property buying agent, is frank: ¡§I¡¦d rather buy a flat in Wuhan than Nine Elms today.¡¨It appears that the world of international diplomacy might feel the same way. The US embassy was supposed to be the first of many missions to migrate across the river, and Nine Elms is still being promoted as ¡§London¡¦s new diplomatic quarter¡¨. China was set to move its embassy here, as was the Netherlands, but both have backed out. The Dutch sold their plot to a hotel developer in 2019, while the Chinese have chosen the decorous surrounds of the old Royal Mint next to the Tower of London. Perhaps they shared Donald Trump¡¦s assessment of Nine Elms, when he refused to cut the ribbon on the new embassy: a ¡§lousy location¡¨.The turbo-charged speculative development along the river has its origins in an unlikely place. It was the socialist mayor of London Ken Livingstone who first designated this part of the capital as one of his 28 ¡§opportunity areas¡¨ in the 2004 London Plan, along with places such as King¡¦s Cross, Elephant and Castle, the Greenwich peninsula and Paddington. The strategy was for a Robin Hood model of regeneration: a tidal wave of foreign investment would be actively encouraged, and tall buildings welcomed, in the belief that a large bounty could be creamed off for the public good. The target was for half of the housing to be affordable. If developers couldn¡¦t meet this target, they would have to produce a financial viability assessment to prove why it wasn¡¦t possible.But it didn¡¦t quite go according to plan. Rather than being an exception, viability became used as a regular get-out clause. Each time, it was a similar story: having paid so much for the land, and expecting costly construction fees, while forecasting low sales prices, the developers could make it look like they simply wouldn¡¦t have any money left to pay for affordable housing. Meanwhile, the viability assessment allowed their 20% profit margin to be safely preserved.In 2012, just as the plan for the VNEB area was being drawn up in City Hall, the Conservative-led coalition government accelerated this trend by placing viability at the very core of national planning policy: the ability of the developer to make a profit would trump everything else. They then watered down the definition of ¡§affordable¡¨ housing to mean up to 80% of market rate ¡V hardly affordable for many in London. With David Cameron in No 10, Boris Johnson in City Hall, Wandsworth council¡¦s former leader Edward Lister as Johnson¡¦s deputy mayor for planning, and Ravi Govindia at Wandsworth town hall, the VNEB opportunity area became the ultimate testing ground for this mighty engine of deregulation, a developer free-for-all where anything would go.Smoothing the path was Peter Bingle, a former flatmate of Govindia, and a Wandsworth councillor turned housebuilder lobbyist. His company, Terrapin Communications, has worked on behalf of a number of landowners and developers in the area, including Ballymore and Bellway, to help assist the passage of planning applications for hundreds of luxury homes. In 2018, a freedom of information request uncovered a cache of emails showing Bingle asking Govindia to intervene in decisions and circumvent council officials he believed were being obstructive to his clients. (There is no suggestion of wrongdoing.) In 1987, when he was chairman of the council¡¦s property sales committee, Bingle stated: ¡§My aim is to reduce the number of Council properties in Wandsworth from 35,000 to 20,000, and to make Battersea a Conservative constituency.¡¨ In critics¡¦ eyes, similar ambitions are driving the development of Nine Elms, which will see a new ward boundary drawn around the luxury enclave.¡§Tory-led Wandsworth has always pioneered the neoliberal policies that created the housing crisis,¡¨ said Aydin Dikerdem, a Labour councillor for the Queenstown ward, in which much of the development is underway. ¡§They launched the right to buy before it was national policy, and accomplished the mass privatisation and demolition of entire estates, as well as the outsourcing of services. What¡¦s going on in Nine Elms and Battersea has nothing to do with maximising social good or creating mixed communities. It is pure social cleansing.¡¨Govindia insists that Wandsworth ¡§hasn¡¦t stopped building housing, it¡¦s just not as plentiful as it has been in the past¡¨. He said that the council has embarked on a programme to build 1,000 homes ¡§in the nooks and crannies¡¨ of existing council estates, with 60% at social rent levels. (The Labour leader of Lambeth, Jack Hopkins, declined to be interviewed for this article.)Dikerdem identifies one particular element as the ¡§cardinal sin¡¨ of the whole regeneration project. As part of the plan, the Northern line is being extended south-westwards, with two new tube stations, one at Nine Elms and one at Battersea Power Station, part-funded by the developers to the tune of 266.4m ¡V money, he argues, that would otherwise have been spent on affordable housing. The 2012 planning framework states that, while both Lambeth and Wandsworth would usually demand between 33-40% affordable housing, contributions towards transport infrastructure should be prioritised here instead. Given the need to pay for the tube stations, it concludes, a target of just 15% affordable housing should be allowed. ¡§It is pure taxpayer subsidy to improve house prices in a luxury development,¡¨ said Dikerdem.While the affordable housing quota averages around 18% across the VNEB area ¡V including council-owned sites ¡V and more like 21% in the part that sits within Labour-led Lambeth, it has been reduced even further in the case of the Battersea Power Station development. Having originally agreed to make 15% of the 4,239 planned homes affordable, the Malaysian-owned development company convinced the council to slash the number by 250 to just 9% in 2017, citing ¡§technical issues¡¨ with restoring the historic structure. Here, the separation between the haves and have-nots will be even more acute. While the flats for private sale are housed in overwrought buildings by Norman Foster and Frank Gehry, which do their best to block views of the power station from all directions, the ¡§affordable¡¨ homes are being built half a kilometre away, across the busy main road, and butted up against the railway tracks. Residents will have little chance of feeling part of what the developers describe as ¡§one of the most exciting and innovative mixed-use neighbourhoods in the world¡¨.The depressing reality of what has happened here becomes all the more stark when you look across the river. Right opposite the power station stands Churchill Gardens, a vast postwar housing estate designed by distinguished architects Powell and Moya, built to house 5,000 people across a 12-hectare site, with several blocks now listed and around half still council-owned. Built by Westminster City Council, it was designed to accommodate a balanced cross-section of society, with the highest standards of housing for all ¡V and not a segregated entrance in sight.¡§There was once a world where you could build riverside council homes,¡¨ said Dikerdem. ¡§We¡¦ve gone backwards since then. That¡¦s why what has happened here is so upsetting. We are never again going to have all this abandoned industrial space on the river, which could have really transformed the lives of people in a borough in which thousands of people are statutorily homeless, and tons of professionals are spending all their income on private rent. It was a historic opportunity, but we¡¦ve ended up with loads more luxury skyscrapers, which is not what the city needed.¡¨ This article was amended on 2 and 4 February 2021. An earlier version named the developers of Churchill Gardens estate as the London County Council and contained an incorrect reference to affordable housing tenants not having access to ¡§the fenced off slivers of lawn¡¨ at the Riverlight development. To clarify: they do have access, although some have experienced technical issues in using their key fobs to gain entry.Some names have been changed.',\n",
              " 'The impossibly tall and thin aesthetic no longer limited to the runways of high fashion, the trend for slenderness has now moved into architectural design as Australian cities follow New York and Hong Kong in the construction of towers as narrow as they are high.Joining the Phoenix Apartments in Flinders Street, Melbourne ¡V which first brought the skinny tower to Australia ¡V will be the proposed Pencil Tower hotel in Sydney and the Magic Tower in Melbourne.The architecture studio behind the Pencil Tower hotel, Durbach Block Jaggers, has described their column tower design as a ¡§sky scratcher ¡K being too thin to really qualify as a skyscraper¡¨.At 6.4 metres wide, 100 metres high and 34 metres deep, once completed the Pencil Tower hotel will overtake what is currently the thinnest, tallest building in Melbourne, the Phoenix Apartments.To make such a narrow site work, Neil Durbach, the architect of the Pencil Tower hotel, has said ¡§each hotel room is super compact, it¡¦s almost like a train compartment.¡¨But this intense compactness is offset by generous shared space, according to Durbach, including a big public room at the base, as well as a hammam bathhouse and pool at the top.Such ¡§unique projects ¡K are a way of imagining a more fantastical future for the city¡¨, he says.These buildings have already been lauded for their ingenuity. Decibel Architecture¡¦s Magic Tower won Silver in the 2018 London Design awards for Architecture-Proposed, and the Pencil Tower hotel has been announced the winner of the City of Sydney¡¦s Design Excellence competition.What¡¦s driving the trend?According to Deena Ridenour, associate professor of practice in urban design at the Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning, the trend for super tall, slender towers is ¡§a product of the growth of our CBDs and the lack of land available for growth.¡¨¡§There are not a lot of big parcels of land left, and it¡¦s very expensive to put different parcels together,¡¨ Ridenour says. ¡§Often there¡¦s just not the opportunity anymore because a lot of what is left is smaller properties, so going slim and tall is the only way to get development capacity in the strategic centres.¡¨In December last year the City of Sydney raised its building height restrictions to allow for buildings taller than 300 metres as part of ¡§the most detailed planning review of the city centre in more than four decades.¡¨Ridenour highlights the situation in the Melbourne and Sydney CBDs as very different from the situation in Parramatta, in western Sydney, where ¡§development controls are encouraging amalgamation of properties¡¨.Anja Morgan of Easton Planning Consultants says ¡§everyone is trying to maximise their site, so I think we will definitely be seeing more of them.¡¨But is this a good thing?¡§Architecturally, they can be landmarks,¡¨ says Dr Arianna Brambilla, lecturer in architectural technology at the Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning. But ¡§towers always come with a lot of provocation, they cause a lot of debate. It¡¦s something you either love or hate¡¨.They can also be challenging to build.¡§Structurally the slender shape is not optimised to resisting to the wind because they offer two different resistances to two different sides, as opposed to square shape buildings which have the same surface exposed to the wind in all directions,¡¨ she says.¡§Secondly, the shape is not optimised for building service spaces like elevators, which usually take up 30% of the space in a normal tower. In a slender building it reduces the usable floor space inside.¡¨Buildings such as Pencil Tower hotel and the Magic Tower have yet to see completion, but in cities such as New York, where such buildings have been around for longer, cracks have started to show.An expos? published this week by the New York Times reported wind-related problems.¡§Wind sway can cause the cables in the elevator shaft to slap around and lead to slowdowns or shutdowns,¡¨ the Times reported.According to Morgan, this isn¡¦t something Australians should worry about.¡§The buildings built in Australia probably have higher standards than those built in America. We have a lot of provisions in Australia with regards extensive engineering, structural and wind reports.¡¨¡§The City of Sydney and all councils in the metropolitan area are very good at assessing every development wholesomely,¡¨ Morgan says.¡§Competing for prime CBD real estate is always a struggle. There are many sites which have constraints, and if you can maximise development opportunities it will have social and economic benefits.¡¨Ridenour expresses a similar confidence in Australian building procedures. ¡§We have pretty strong design excellence processes like design competitions to make sure that buildings are designed by the right qualified people.¡¨She says the City of Sydney ensures solar access to certain open spaces is protected and the height plane is adapted to make sure open spaces maintain sunlight.The City of Sydney also says, in a statement to the Guardian, ¡§building height on this site Pencil Tower hotel is restricted to prevent overshadowing of public places in the CBD.¡¨Nevertheless, Ridenour says the compactness of these buildings ¡§puts more pressure on the public domain being where people gather and recreate rather than private communal space.¡¨',\n",
              " 'The Uffizi Gallery, renowned for its Renaissance collection of Botticellis and Michelangelos, has acquired a work by a British street artist who began spray-painting in London a decade ago.The gallery in Florence unveiled a self-portrait by the UK-based artist Endless on Monday. The montage, a comment on advertising and consumer culture, will become the first piece by a street artist to go on display in the Uffizi.Endless, who keeps his identity hidden, said he was ¡§excited and honoured¡¨, adding: ¡§I didn¡¦t know how it would fit into the gallery exactly.¡¨ The work¡¦s inclusion ¡§breaks the mould¡¨ for street art, he said, and, in a year in which galleries and museums have closed their doors, showed how important the art form had become.The self-portrait features two photographs of the artist stacked on top of each other. His face is obscured by a reworking of a Calvin Klein advert, in which Mark Wahlberg appeared in briefs. Endless first began painting this ¡§crotch grab¡¨ image on London walls in 2014. To either side of the artist are photos of the art duo Gilbert and George, mentors and early supporters of his work.Though the piece strays from the Renaissance canon for which the Uffizi is renowned, the gallery¡¦s director, Eike Schmidt, said it ¡§references artworks we have in the collection on multiple levels¡¨.¡§The crotch grab references the pose of the Venus de¡¦ Medici sculpture and Botticelli¡¦s Venus but transplants it from the female to the male body. We also have several group portraits; the most famous would be Rubens¡¦ Four Philosophers.¡¨The advertising-inspired crotch grab was less provocative than the Uffizi¡¦s Renaissance pieces, Endless said. ¡§I don¡¦t think it¡¦s any more scandalous than the nudes that are already in there. He¡¦s got pants on.¡¨Endless said including street artists in museums was a way of ¡§pushing things forward¡¨. ¡§Some street artists would never touch a gallery but most street artists are artists in their own right and a lot would want to do gallery shows.¡¨Street art was a means for Endless to ¡§advertise¡¨ his talent. Having trained in fine art for six years, it took over five more years for the artist to be selected for his first exhibition. He spent his time creating artwork on walls across east and west London. ¡§At one point I was doing street art four or five times a week, making it during the day and putting it up at night,¡¨ he said.In 2014 and 2015 he began creating street art ¡§prolifically¡¨, and he first featured in exhibitions in 2016. In 2018, Schmidt approached him to ask for a donation.Endless said the inclusion of his work was a culmination of a decade in which street art had ¡§gained more respect¡¨. ¡§Banksy created the foundations by using the media to push street art into a certain direction.¡¨The art form has gained further prominence during the pandemic with the help of social media. Last July Banksy graffitied a London tube train with cartoon rats, while telling people to wear masks via his Instagram page.Endless said: ¡§When everything was shut during the pandemic, more street art appeared illegally and some big murals were planned. People were going on their daily walks and seeing street art even more.¡§The pandemic has shown the strength of artwork in general. People need it. They want to go to the museums and galleries but they can¡¦t so they¡¦ve gone online.¡¨While British galleries remain closed, the Uffizi is open to visitors. Schmidt hopes the Italian gallery can bring street art to new audiences when Endless¡¦s piece goes on display this summer. Though taking street art off the street ¡§changes its character¡¨, he conceded, ¡§if you give us two or three years, there will be more street artists added to our collection.¡¨',\n",
              " 'Generations of female artists, composers and writers have been lost to history because their names changed after marriage. According to growing academic consensus, the conventional switch of surnames at the altar has erased a key cultural legacy. And the story of the painter and designer Isabel Rawsthorne, told in a new biography, is among the first to make this powerful argument.A star of the London art scene in the late 1940s and 50s, Rawsthorne was billed as one of five key artists to watch alongside Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. Yet her striking paintings are now attached, piecemeal, to the three other names she used. As a result, she appears simply as a string of footnotes, best known as the muse of her famous lovers, the sculptors Jacob Epstein and Alberto Giacometti.Dr Carol Jacobi, author of the new study of Rawsthorne, Out of the Cage, published by Thames & Hudson, believes it is a question of now hauling significant female artists ¡§out of the shadows¡¨.¡§Power really does reside in a name,¡¨ said Jacobi, a curator at Tate Britain. ¡§When Rawsthorne died no one connected her to the artist known as Isabel Lambert, who had created so many designs during the Festival of Britain, nor to the bohemian muse Isabel Delmer, and certainly not to the promising artist Isabel Nicholas, who had exhibited in London in the 1930s.¡¨Jacobi believes many artistic legacies have been mislaid this way. A child prodigy such as Emma Jones, said Jacobi, has limited recognition now only because her husband, Alexis Soyer, made sure her work was credited when she died in childbirth, aged 28, in 1842. Other artists yet to be retrieved from the margins include the American modernist Helen Torr, whose career, despite early acclaim in the 1920s in New York, was overshadowed by her husband, the abstract artist Arthur Dove.In Scotland, Margaret Macdonald, wife of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is gradually being acknowledged beyond academic circles. She created many features of her husband¡¦s popular work, shaping the ¡§Glasgow Style¡¨ of the 1890s, as he acknowledged, writing: ¡§Margaret has genius, I have only talent.¡¨The problem is widespread across culture, according to the crusading academic Anna Beer, author of Sounds and Sweet Airs: the Forgotten Women of Classical Music. ¡§The problem really started in the 19th century when the idea of a wife as property took hold,¡¨ she said. ¡§Before that, in the previous 200 years, women artists and musicians often hung on to a family name if it positioned them helpfully as part of a creative dynasty.¡¨Beer also believes an immoral taint on artistic effort in the Victorian era stopped women putting themselves forward. Writing for public consumption was seen as akin to prostitution. ¡§So you can see why women chose to publish anonymously or adopted men¡¦s names,¡¨ she said.Rawsthorne¡¦s extraordinary life began in 1912 when she was born to the middle-class Nicholas family. As a child growing up on the Wirral, her aptitude for art was clear. At 16, she found a way to try life drawing, which was forbidden, by hiring a room where fellow art school students could model.Arriving at the Royal Academy of Art in 1931, on a rare scholarship for a young woman, her studies were cut short when her father died. But by then she had staged her own shows and met Epstein and his wife, Margaret, eventually moving in with them as a convenient life model. When she became pregnant by Epstein, she decided to hand the baby over to the couple.Moving to Paris, her painting style developed and she married the British journalist and anti-Nazi ¡§black propaganda¡¨ supremo Sefton Delmer, taking his name as a form of protection during travels in civil war-torn Spain, where they were captured briefly by rebels. She gathered intelligence and worked for a period at the covert propaganda bureau in Aspley Guise, near Bletchley Park, run by her husband.As her art moved from surrealism towards studies of animals and human figures, she returned to Paris and met Giacometti, whose work is believed to have been strongly influenced by her long, lean form.Back in London and divorced from Delmer, she was the subject of a series of exhibitions and began a relationship with her second-husband-to-be, the celebrated composer Constant Lambert, a man initially also engaged to prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn.Now ¡§Mrs Lambert¡¨, she worked on the designs for the notoriously risque Festival of Britain ballet Tiresias, performed in Britain in only one production at Sadler¡¦s Wells. A show at the prestigious Hanover Gallery in London followed and she was once again hailed as a talent.After Lambert¡¦s death, she moved to the Essex countryside and married her third husband, the composer Alan Rawsthorne. ¡§That was Isabel¡¦s surname when she died but, of course, no one connected it to her previous lives,¡¨ said Jacobi, adding that none of these marriages brought her the position or security others might have sought. ¡§Instead, Isabel just had to start again at least twice because of her new married identities.¡¨A 2016 YouGov poll found that more than half of single British women still planned to change their name at marriage, although this marked a 30% fall on the current rate. Separate research has also noted a growing trend to adopt a double-barrelled joint surname on marriage.What¡¦s in a name, as Shakespeare¡¦s Juliet asked? Well, according to Beer, it is a strong bit of branding for any artist and, in the case of a male genius such as Shakespeare, several different spellings of his surname, coupled with scant archival evidence, did not stop the building of a legacy. ¡§Scholars can find a way around it if they want,¡¨ she said.',\n",
              " 'Life finally starts to feel like it¡¦s shuffling forward now, with a path out of lockdown and the vaccination programme throwing doors open for the first time in a year. There¡¦s optimism to be found in new sustainable buildings recognised by the EU Mies Award for contemporary architecture and new ¡§warm¡¨ technology which keeps people connected and a chance to support the craft industries this week at the Collect Art Fair.For more design features, sign up to the Design Review newsletterTaking its name from founder Ulrich Sch?rer and the Swiss village of M?nsingen where the family-owned company is still based, USM modular furniture is a 136-year-old brand known for its functional, sustainable and high-quality products. Sheet-steel panels that can be joined together in endlessly versatile possibilities. The USM Haller System, designed in conjunction with architect Fritz Haller, is still used in open-plan offices around the world today. It is furniture that defies trends, that is sustainable by intention.When Z?rich¡¦s Museum of Design recently moved into new premises, it faced a problem. For the first time a 150-year-old collection comprising half a million examples of graphics, posters, textiles and furniture was housed under one roof. How were they going to display it all? They soon realised the solution was staring them in the face: USM modular furniture that had been part of its permanent collection for decades.Haller also built USM¡¦s company building (1963), office pavilion (1965) and the Sch?rer family¡¦s private residence (1968), all of which follow the company¡¦s functional design principals. The latter, built on a steep slope with commanding views in every direction, has now been meticulously renovated in accordance with the original construction principals and historic preservation guidelines.¡§It¡¦s where my sister and I grew up,¡¨ explains Alex Sch?rer, the fourth generation of the family and USM CEO. ¡§I lived there from the age of five until I went to college at 18. The family home is important to me personally but this house is particularly important to the company. It was the prototype of a building system designed by Fritz Haller and manufactured under the guidance of my father.¡§Haller was a visionary, who constantly sought to reduce any solution to its simplest form. He always arrived at rigorous lasting solutions, and the USM Haller product is testament to that, nearly 60 years later.¡¨Collect, the only fair dedicated to contemporary craft, launches online this week. Replacing the usual pilgrimage to London¡¦s Somerset House to see some of the best designs created by craftspeople in the last five years, online art platform artsy.net is collaborating with the Crafts Council to host Collect. This year 32 exhibitors will present work by more than 400 artists from 35 different countries including the UK, Thailand, Japan and the USA.There¡¦s a strong interest in crafts at the moment. A 2020 report Crafts Council report Market for Craft found that 73% of participants had bought craft in the last year, with a third of shoppers aged under 35. These new fans will find lots to enjoy at Collect including jewellery from House on Mars, ceramics by Ting-Ying gallery and lacquer craft from The Gallery by SOIL.Also look out for free virtual events and talks across art, fashion, interiors and culture, including a conversation between ceramicist Magdalene Odundo and Gus Casely-Hayford, director of the V&A East, and Edmund de Waal talking about the meaning of craft today.Collect Art Fair runs from 26 February - 2 March 2021¡§Supernovas never die, they just explode creating new stars.¡¨ So reads the manifesto of circular design company Supernovas, founded by designer Massimiliano Rossi, which aims to reuse, recycle, reimagine and reinvent products for homes and businesses. Launched last year with offices in London and Milan, the company¡¦s debut collections are Volta, a bright, Lego-y tableware range designed by Brazilian clothes and homeware designer Paula Cademartori, and Afterlife, a biopmorphic furniture line created with Dutch design studio Odd Matter. All products are made from recycled plastic waste such as bottles, pipes, toys and product packaging. And to make sure their products never become waste, Supernovas has created Streaming, a subscription service that lets customers swap or return products when they tire of them.As well as making their own creations, Supernovas works with businesses on sustainability and circular economy strategies, from waste material collection to product design. Projects in their first year include making 3D-printed mugs out of rubbish from a music festival and working with the first Italian fast food restaurant made entirely from recycled materials.Artist Jason Polan¡¦s sketches and ideas were unique. His ideas were both inclusive and often definitive. His projects include the art book The Every Piece of Art in the Museum of Modern Art Book and a sketch column for the New York Times called simply Things I saw. He also started the Taco Bell Drawing Club in 2013, where anyone could come and meet him to sketch and draw at Taco Bell, just off Union Square, New York.His best known scheme was Every Person in New York, an attempt to draw everyone in the city. People could contact Polan and let him know where they¡¦d be to make sure they were included and he also just sketched everyone he laid eyes on. The project blog is full of frenetic sketches with titles such as Three People on Q Train December 10, 2019 or Woman walking up Crosby at Broome December 7, 2016. He¡¦d managed 30,000 portraits by the time he published a book of the work in progress in 2015.Sadly, there will never be another book. Polan died of cancer last year, aged just 37. This month, Uniqlo has released a clothing collection featuring Polan¡¦s work including Every Person in New York and also asked for people to join The World¡¦s Biggest Drawing Club ¡V posting their own drawings of everyday things ¡V in memory of Polan. It¡¦s easy to imagine Polan appreciating the project - much as he¡¦d like everyday people wearing T-shirts featuring his everyday people and finding something special in it.While Japanese ceramics are world renowned, one fascinating area has yet to find international fame. Kasama in Ibaraki prefecture is surrounded by mountains, a small crucible which has produced a remarkable and eclectic mix of ceramic styles. While Japanese work such as Arita ware or Bizen ware follows centuries of traditions, Kasama¡¦s 250 potters are a small group working in an area with no fixed styles. This may turn out to be their strength. A new initiative organised by Japan¡¦s trade ministry is actively promoting Kasama as a destination for ceramics and fostering a relationship with the potteries of Stoke-on-Trent.Ryoko Mutasono, the London director of the Kasama Potters project says: ¡§With the recent resurgence of trends in handicraft and craftsmanship, it was hypothesised that the style of Kasama-ware ¡V one unbound by tradition, that allows makers to create freely ¡V would suit the European lifestyle. We believe Kasama¡¦s individual expression could attract new pottery fans.¡¨Covid permitting, expect to see Kasama-ware at events such as Stoke¡¦s British Ceramics Bicentennial and London Craft Week. To check out the remarkable variety of Kasama pottery from artisans such as Giran Sagawa and Makoto Oki, visit the Kasama Potters website.Loneliness and a lack of human contact are two major problems with the prolonged lockdowns of the last year. Last November, the Office for National Statistics found acute loneliness had climbed to record levels, with 8% of adults (around 4.2 million people) feeling ¡§always or often lonely¡¨, and 16-29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to experience loneliness during lockdown.One Norwegian company ¡V straightforwardly called No Isolation ¡V is focused on using technology to overcome the barriers that keep us apart. They call this ¡§warm¡¨ technology. ¡§It¡¦s a term that we¡¦ve coined to describe products specifically designed to enable an engaging communication for people at risk of social isolation and loneliness,¡¨ explains Harriet Gridley, UK director of No Isolation. ¡§It¡¦s different from ¡¥tech for good¡¦, which sees existing tools used towards a good end.¡¨Its first invention was AV1, a distance-learning robot avatar that acts as a child¡¦s eyes, ears and voice in the classroom. It was developed to help the many children kept out of school by disability or long-term illness, but has clear applications for schools and businesses in the post-Covid world.¡§We have all now experienced a degree of social isolation, so there is an increased understanding of those for whom this is the norm. It has also led to a rapid digital wave in schools and care homes, as they have been forced to improve their infrastructures and skills,¡¨ says Gridley.KOMP is No Isolation¡¦s latest product ¡V a one-button computer for groups who are not experienced with digital technology to share photos and make video calls.¡§Not everyone has the ability to go back to school, work, or whatever ¡¥normality¡¦ is after this pandemic,¡¨ says Gridley. ¡§Even as lockdown lifts, there will still be many thousands of people who justly feel that society has designed them out of the frame ¡V our job at No Isolation is to design them back into it.¡¨This month, the nominated entries for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture ¡V Mies van der Rohe Award have been announced. More snappily known as the EU Mies Award, this biennial prize for contemporary European architecture promotes and rewards aesthetic and technological excellence in design and construction, especially for projects which are also a response to the ridiculous times we live in. This set of buildings were mainly commissioned during the financial crisis of 2007-2012 and completed during the Covid pandemic ¡V all against a backdrop of climate crisis and social unrest.¡§The EU Mies Award shows that quality can be understood in many different ways but that it must always be connected to the challenges with the environment and make cities and infrastructure more sustainable and resilient¡¨ says Anna Ramos, director of the Mies van der Rohe Foundation.Though it¡¦s wrong to have favourites, the new bus station in Vilkavi?kis, a regional Lithuanian town, feels like the epitome of these architectural objectives. Built by Balcytis Studija, the bus station works not only as a transport hub but also as a green space and social arena which can host markets and concerts. None of this involves compromising the modernist glamour of the station.The next set of Mies Award nominees are released in September.',\n",
              " 'A collection of bright pink seesaws that allowed people to interact over the US-Mexico border has won the prestigious Design of the Year award, with its creators saying they hoped the work encourages people to build bridges between communities.The Teeter Totter Wall, which bridged across El Paso in Texas and Ciudad Ju?rez in Mexico during a 40-minute session, was described as not only feeling ¡§symbolically important¡¨ but also highlighting ¡§the possibility of things¡¨ by the judging panel.The creators of the seesaws, Ronald Rael, a professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and Virginia San Fratello, an associate professor of design at San Jos? State University, first came up with the idea a decade ago after the Secure Fence Act 2006, which started large-scale building on the border.They said they hoped the design would help people reassess the effectiveness of borders and encourage dialogue rather than division. San Fratello said: ¡§I think it¡¦s become increasingly clear with the recent events in our country that we don¡¦t need to build walls we need to build bridges.¡¨¡§Walls don¡¦t stop people from entering our Capitol,¡¨ Rael added. ¡§Walls don¡¦t stop viruses from moving. We have to think about how we can be connected and be together without hurting each other.¡¨Videos of people interacting and playing across the border on the day-glo creations went viral in July 2019, with Rael saying they provided ¡§a literal fulcrum¡¨ between the countries. The bright pink colouring was inspired by the femicide memorials in Ciudad Juarez, which pay homage to women murdered in the city.The designers also took inspiration from political cartoonists and wanted to talk about the border issue in ¡§a very frank way but using humour¡¨.The border wall has become a legacy issue for Donald Trump, however the designers point out that both George W Bush and Barack Obama built large stretches of barriers and deported thousands of people.Rael said: ¡§Trump ran on a platform of saying that he was going to build a wall as if some Saviour had finally arrived to build a wall but in fact two thirds of the wall had already been constructed.¡¨In one of his last trips as President, Donald Trump visited part of the border wall in Texas¡¦ Rio Grande Valley with his administration boasting about having kept the president¡¦s promise to build a ¡§big, beautiful wall¡¨.According to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) more than 450 miles of wall had been erected during Trump¡¦s tenure, however much of the construction replaced barriers that were already in place. The CBP stated that there were only 80 miles of barrier in areas which had previously had none.The winning design saw off competition from more than 70 nominees, which included a 3D rendering of the virus causing Covid-19, Lee Ha Jun¡¦s set design from Parasite, the Oscar-winning South Korean film, and the union flag stab-proof vest worn by Stormzy at Glastonbury 2019.Awards were also given to six category winners with prizes recognising innovation in product, architecture, digital, fashion, graphics and transport.The product award went to the vegan Impossible Burger 2.0, which was described as being crucially ¡§beefier¡¨ than its 2016 predecessor, while the 3D rendering of the Covid-19 virus by Alissa Eckert and Dan Higgins took the graphics prize.The vegan leather, gender neutral Telfar bag, which was described as being ¡§the accessory of the decade¡¨ by Dazed, won the fashion prize with judges saying it was redefining ¡§what luxury means¡¨. Social Design Collaborative¡¦s portable school design won the architecture prize, with the easily assembled, sustainably made Indian structure impressing the judges.The Chilean feminist group Colectivo LASTESIS won the digital category with its protest against the use of sexual violence in the recent uprisings in the South American country. The artist Camille Walala said the work had been replicated by replicated by feminists in India, Kenya and Mexico.The People¡¦s Choice award was given to the brick arches made by protesters in Hong Kong, which were used to slow down police vehicles during the protests in 2019.',\n",
              " '¡§Gordon Parks¡¦s photographs are timeless,¡¨ said Peter W Kunhardt Jr, executive director of the Gordon Parks Foundation. ¡§As we reflect on what has happened in recent months, his photographs remind us to stand up, speak out and demand justice. This exhibition does just that, highlighting images that inspire resilience and empathy that the photographer made over many years.¡¨The two-part exhibition, on view at both Jack Shainman Gallery locations in New York, is called Gordon Parks: Half and the Whole and until 20 February, photos from Parks taken between 1942 and 1970 will be showcased.There are portraits of political leaders, protest images and stills from the civil rights movement, from Malcolm X to Muhammad Ali and Black Panther party members Eldridge and Kathleen Cleaver. There are photos from the segregated south, and from a police brutality protest in 1963, which has a striking resemblance to today¡¦s America, over 50 years later.His work is also on view in an exhibition at the Mobile Museum of Art in Mobile, Alabama, featuring his photos of segregation in America. Also, the Gordon Parks Museum in Fort Scott recently received funding for a research project to document the shooting locations of The Learning Tree, a coming-of-age drama Parks wrote and directed in 1969 (he was the first African American to write and direct a Hollywood feature film based on his bestselling novel).Parks, born in 1912, grew up on a farm in Kansas and attended a segregated elementary school before leaving home at 14. He lived in St Paul as a teenager, where he got into fashion photography, and later, lived in Chicago and Washington before becoming the first black photographer to shoot for Life Magazine in 1957.In the 1950s, he traveled across the country with detectives, as they chased criminals from New York to Los Angeles in a crime series he did for Life, (in one he took in Chicago, he photographed a black man and woman being taken away by cops on a street from a window above).He is renowned for capturing daily life in Alabama, showing black families at home, at work and shopping, while living under the harsh rule of Jim Crow laws. Parks is also praised as the director of the 1971 film, Shaft, which spearheaded the blaxploitation genre, starring Richard Roundtree, known as ¡§the first black action hero¡¨.Pulitzer prize-nominated writer and Columbia University professor Jelani Cobb has written an essay to accompany the Jack Shainman exhibition. ¡§One of the things that stood out for me is the contemporary implications of this work,¡¨ said Cobb. ¡§I wasn¡¦t trying to force it into the present. It was just there. In Gordon Parks¡¦s memoir, he talks about setting out to chronicle the lives and the world that black people were living in and happening in his life. We see that many of those things he was trying to shed a light on are still the case. They¡¦re still applicable.¡¨He writes in his accompanying essay that: ¡§There is nothing in Parks¡¦s body of work that includes the phrase ¡¥Black Lives Matter,¡¦ but it didn¡¦t need to. He¡¦d already shown that they do, minute after minute, across the void from his time to our own.¡¨It certainly sums up 2020, partly in connection to the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd in May. ¡§I was drawn to issues of police and policing because that has been at the center of our understanding around our concerns around race,¡¨ said Cobb.Some of the most compelling photos in the exhibition include a portrait of Ella Watson, a woman with a mop and broom, posing while standing before the American flag. Or his photo of a black woman and her daughter, both adorned in beautiful dresses, while standing before the ¡§Colored Entrance¡¨ of a department store in Alabama, dated 1956.Deborah Willis, the chair of photography at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, has curated Parks¡¦s work in over 30 exhibitions. She says that the photographer was not only there to document everyday life during turmoil for many African Americans, but to give them hope.¡§More than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we continue the struggle for human rights and equal justice; and I see this exhibition as an intimate story and critical to opening up a broader discussion on change and activism in light of the recent news,¡¨ said Willis. ¡§It reminds us that the photographer witnessed an abundance of events that challenged our understanding of injustices, police brutality, war and peace that were bookmarked by the life and death of Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X.¡¨She asks: ¡§How does one not look back at social protest images without connecting to Gordon Parks and his focus on the beauty of family love, resistance and struggle?¡¨Willis cites Dr King¡¦s writings and lectures about his dream of a Beloved Community, which teaches the idea that for a society to overcome racism, poverty and discrimination, that we must embody a kind of sisterhood and brotherhood. ¡§In my view, it¡¦s connected to Gordon Parks¡¦s desire to visualize it and a more just society,¡¨ said Willis.¡§Gordon Parks tells the stories of worship services, shopping and poverty in the American south and New York¡¦s Harlem, as he constructs and reveals the experience of the traumatic effect of lack of education and underemployment, while at the same time, suggests resilience and empowerment through Sunday dress under haunting segregation signs,¡¨ she said. ¡§These images are in our collective memory and we still see them reflected today.¡¨Though the photographer died in 2006, his photos resonate today. So do his words. Parks once said: ¡§I chose my camera as a weapon against all the things I dislike about America ¡V poverty, racism, discrimination.¡¨¡§It¡¦s crucial that we try to listen to what Gordon Parks is trying to tell us, his work is a testament, and his legacy endures,¡¨ said Cobb. ¡§As the exhibit points to, his work is as every bit relevant as it was when he was among us, taking these images.¡¨',\n",
              " 'A classic tintype photo from the 19th century showing a civil war soldier, whose garments are hand-colored in gold paint. The soldier, crowned by a gold frame, looks forward, holding a gun over his chest.But rather than just any war portrait, it¡¦s part of the overlooked history of African American soldiers who fought during the period. This one and more are featured in a new book called The Black Civil War Soldier: A Visual History of Conflict and Citizenship.The book features more than 70 images of black soldiers who fought in the civil war, alongside handwritten letters, recruitment posters, old newspaper clippings and personal journal entries. One recruitment poster from 1863 reads: ¡§Men of color to arms!¡¨¡§The archive speaks,¡¨ writes the book¡¦s author, Deborah Willis, a photo historian and New York University professor. ¡§If we search, if we listen, it can reveal worlds of brutality and kindness, of shame and glory. In this book, I want you to see and hear the world of the black soldiers and the wives and mothers of the civil war.¡¨The book aims to bring these stoic portraits of black soldiers to life ¡V with personal stories, to family members back home, and interviews with historians and personal observations from a skilled photography expert. It¡¦s what Willis calls the African American experience, as well as resilience.This book tells tales of courage, discrimination, pay inequalities and heroism. ¡§By examining diary pages, letters and news items, I want to build on the stories that each of their portraits tell,¡¨ she said to the Guardian. ¡§To focus a lens on their hopefulness and the sense of what could be won from loss.¡¨The civil war, waged from 1861 to 1865, began in a divided America after a dispute over slavery. While Abraham Lincoln was president, it was fought between the northern states (Union soldiers) and the southern states (Confederate), who were pro-slavery. After the Union defeated the Confederate states, slavery was abolished across the country during the Reconstruction era that followed ¡V but of course, the actual narrative is not that simple.¡§I used to hear often about the civil war that the north won the war, but the south won the narrative,¡¨ said Willis, referring to how African Americans were depicted in pop culture and films like Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind. ¡§Both were acts of preserving the triumph narrative and restaging events from the civil war and American slavery.¡¨When the war began in 1861, black soldiers weren¡¦t allowed to fight. That changed when Lincoln freed slaves and allowed them to join the Union army as part of the United States Colored Troops. Black and minority soldiers were led by white officers. ¡§As a photo historian, I question invisibility, and through family stories, private and public archives we can see a broader history,¡¨ adds Willis.Roughly 179,000 men fought as part of the troops, with 37,000 dying in battle, and many of the surviving black soldiers winning honors and medals in the navy and army, as this book reveals.Considering photography was still new at the time, the civil war was one of the first major conflicts to be documented in such a vivid way. It helped create ¡§a national vision of blackness and war,¡¨ Willis writes in the book, which retells the story of black lives during the war ¡V which has been seen, but not necessarily heard.The photos in the book include unidentified black soldiers, alongside a portrait of Sget Tom Strawn from the US Colored Troops¡¦ Heavy Artillery Regiment, another shows a group of soldiers, who were known as the Tenth Army Corps, a Union regiment of escaped slaves. They stand together in South Carolina, posing for a photo in 1864.The book includes a portrait of Harriet Tubman, a photograph of Charles Douglass (Frederick Douglass¡¦s son) and Lincoln standing with Union army soldiers.There are also shots of black hospital workers in Nashville in 1863, and a portrait of Thomas Morris Chester, the first black war correspondent for a major daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Press, from 1870.¡§I wanted to personalize it by including pages from diaries and highlighting letters written by black soldiers and their mothers who wrote to Abraham Lincoln expressing their desire to fight, while mothers demanded their sons received equal pay and treatment,¡¨ said Willis. ¡§Free black men and women contributed in various ways by teaching, nursing and practicing medicine. Who knew nine black surgeons served during the war?¡¨Many of the portraits were taken so soldiers could send them back home with letters to their wives, mothers and daughters (many of the photos are sourced from museum collections, like the Library of Congress and the National Archives, among others, as well as university collections).Today, the African American Civil War Museum in Washington pays tribute to the largely ignored historic contribution that black troops (over 200,000) made to the civil war, by fighting for freedom from slavery, as do several other museums.¡§The photographs became the visual evidence that slavery happened, and black resistance endured,¡¨ said Willis. ¡§This book weaves a narrative on the history of American photography during its early years, with iconic moments of the southern landscape, letter writing, the Works Progress Administration slave narratives and first-hand accounts of experiences.¡¨The history of the lives of black soldiers was erased with racism and prejudice in the years that followed. ¡§Who controls the narrative?¡¨ asks Willis. ¡§Black and white historians spent decades researching and publishing on this era.¡¨Just like the image on the cover of the book, depicting one black soldier, his stoic gaze represents more than what most can see. Each tintype portrait of these black civil war soldiers was symbolic.¡§They had to stand in front of the camera and to be photographed, to be depicted as men who had made a choice ¡V a choice of freedom,¡¨ said Willis. ¡§As soon as they were given uniforms, from forage caps to weapons, many posed holding their weapons. The visual narrative suggests their commitment to fight for freedom for all bonded people.¡¨',\n",
              " 'What if the Olympics were upstaged by a cat? It¡¦s a real danger. Considerable interest has recently been generated by a 3D-animated giant calico creature that mews and wiggles from a newly installed billboard at passengers coming and going from Tokyo¡¦s Shinjuku station. It¡¦s hard to detect similar excitement about the architectural offering at the city¡¦s Olympic Games, which are due to open a year late on 23 July.Nor is it likely to match the impact of the city¡¦s last Olympics in 1964. This was, according to the New York Times, ¡§a debutante ball for democratic postwar Japan¡¨, one that ¡§crowned Tokyo¡¦s 20-year transformation from a firebombed ruin to an ultramodern megalopolis¡¨. It was a festival of construction and design as well as sport: not just the striking Olympic facilities, but also the elevated highways that made Tokyo into the law-abiding version of Blade Runner that it is today ¡V and the first of Japan¡¦s famous bullet trains.The Games¡¦ architectural star was the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, originally designed by Kenzo Tange for swimming and diving, a swooping marvel of cantilevers and hanging roofs and hovering concrete. If it were built now, it would still get it described as ¡§futuristic¡¨. It gave new form and energy to the concept of high-object Olympic architecture, and other cities would follow: Munich in 1972 brought another floating, swooping object ¡V a tent-like stadium by the architect-engineer Frei Otto; Beijing 2008 had its Bird¡¦s Nest; London 2012 had its Zaha Hadid-designed Aquatics Centre.Tokyo 2020 is at some risk of being the saddest Olympics ever. The state of the pandemic means that the athletes will be performing to mostly empty venues, which will at least spare spectators the sometimes atrocious heat and humidity of midsummer Japan. The quadrennial theatre of ballooning Olympic budgets has reached new levels; some estimates put it at 18.75bn, up from an original budget of 5.26bn. In a recent poll, 83% of Japanese people said they wanted it postponed or cancelled. That same pandemic makes it tricky to see the new venues in the flesh, but from a distance of 6,000 miles they mostly look ho-hum and stodgy, corporate, lacking in spark. Yoshiharu Tsukamoto of Atelier Bow-Wow, one of Japan¡¦s livelier practices, has objected that ¡§we independent artists are banned and totally deleted from the list of the designers. They want a big firm, a corporate firm to work with a construction company. There¡¦s no chance for independent architects.¡¨Wherever that colossal expenditure went, it doesn¡¦t seem to have gone into architectural invention. But there could yet be a silver lining ¡V Tokyo 2020 might represent a welcome shift, if it means that the Olympics are finally weaning themselves off extravagant architectural trophies. Tange and Otto and the like have given the world some glorious moments, but it is surely time, nearly 60 years later, to find other ways of achieving architectural beauty.On top of the podium for drab design is the Olympic Village, an ensemble of generic global apartment blocks, grey and gridded, microscopically enlivened by a few curvy, ribbon-like balustrades, with an all-timber, recyclable Village Plaza ¡V a hub for the athletes with a general store, cafe and media centre. Its larch, cedar and cypress have been sourced from 63 municipalities across Japan, to which it will be returned, such that it can be used for ¡§public benches or parts of school buildings¡¨, as the official blurb puts it. This is fine, as far is it goes, but it looks distinctly tokenistic next to the vast conventional blocks around it.The best-looking new building is the 68,000-seat Japan National Stadium. It is designed by Kengo Kuma, the architect best known in Britain for his V&A museum in Dundee, who won the Tokyo commission when the price tag for a more ambitious design by Zaha Hadid Architects rose past 1.3bn, and was scrapped. Kuma¡¦s version, still costing a not-small 1.2bn, is described as a ¡§living tree¡¨. It uses plenty of timber in its construction and is ringed with prominent horizontals, which are said to evoke the overhanging eaves of traditional Japanese buildings. It¡¦s not radical or groundbreaking and there¡¦s some awkwardness in the way its different parts go together, but it does achieve an overall handsomeness.Otherwise, there is the partly timber Ariake Gymnastics Centre, a reasonably competent essay in overhanging curviness of a kind familiar from previous Olympics. The Aquatics Centre, credited to Yamashita Sekkei and Kenzo Tange¡¦s son, Paul Noritaka Tange, is an inverted part-pyramid with repeating rhythms of sloping slats that looks something like a 1960s embassy in a tropical country, or a library in a midwestern US university. The Ariake Arena (volleyball and Paralympic basketball) is another inverted part-pyramid, this one with a concave roof, zestless in execution. The Musashino Forest Sport Plaza (badminton, fencing and wheelchair basketball) has an oddly warped and sliced vaulted roof, as if someone was trying to emulate the Sydney Opera House but lost heart along the way.In general, old tropes of Olympic hopefulness are trotted out. Walls slope, roofs curve, structures hover, it being a never-ending image of progress to suggest that in the future gravity will act in a different way. Flimsy references are made to traditional Japanese architecture. New nods to sustainability are added to the old repertoire, in particular a vogueish use of timber. Much of the character of these buildings is determined by the fact that they are delivered by Japan¡¦s powerful construction companies, to whom architects must play second fiddle. The contractors tend to have the final say on details, which as a result get the life squeezed out of them.The cancellation of the previous stadium design means that there¡¦s a Hadid-shaped hole when it comes to architectural spectacle. Kenzo Tange¡¦s Yoyogi building, repurposed for Tokyo 2020 for handball and Paralympic badminton and rugby, will still be the Games¡¦ most compelling work of architecture, 57 years on. But here lies the speck of hope. Brand new gestural architecture, like many things from 1964 ¡V those elevated highways for example ¡V looks more questionable now than it did then. Even if they had found the extra cash for the Hadid stadium, it would essentially have been a reworking of the themes of curvaceous anti-gravity that Tange explored all those years ago.The world of construction is slowly waking up to the fact that, as the building of new structures consumes a huge amount of energy and resources, there is a powerful argument for re-using old ones whenever possible. It¡¦s not a bad thing, then, if the most powerful architectural icon of Tokyo 2020 is three years off getting its free bus pass.In fact, 34 of the 42 venues at these Olympics are older buildings reused, which is welcome, even if a mystery remains as to where that vast budget went. Paris, host of the 2024 Olympics, promises that 95% of its venues will be either existing or temporary, and that ¡§its carbon emissions will be halved in comparison to the last two editions of the Summer Games¡¨. The next task is to make refurbishment enticing and delightful ¡V it can be done ¡V or the cat challenge posed by Tokyo 2020 will continue to be flunked.',\n",
              " 'My father, Colin Painter, who has died aged 82, was an artist and art educator who dedicated his career to encouraging participation in the visual arts, and to bridging the gap between the fine art establishment and the general public. A brilliant communicator and hands-on organiser, Colin created many imaginative shows exploring the public¡¦s relationship with art images. These were exhibited at venues including the National Gallery, Tate and the V&A.Most notable among them was At Home with Constable¡¦s Cornfield in 1996 at the National Gallery, which placed Constable¡¦s original painting alongside a variety of reproductions brought from the homes of members of the public, together with discourse on the individual¡¦s connection with their object and the image itself. In At Home With Art (1999), in association with the Arts Council, the Tate and Sainsbury¡¦s, Colin commissioned nine contemporary sculptors (Anthony Gormley, Tony Cragg, Alison Wilding and others) to create an original work which could be mass-produced and offered for sale in DIY outlets - this was intended to explore whether it was cost and availability that discouraged people from placing contemporary art in their homes.These exhibitions and others came out of research Colin conducted in the 1970s for his PhD The Uses of Art (which was published in 1986). He studied the images hanging in 59 diverse households in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, their owner¡¦s thoughts about each work, and whether or not they considered it to be ¡§art¡¨. It was a fascinating study, and of the many findings, two stood out. First, reproductions of paintings by Constable appeared in homes across all the social groups, adorning a variety of household objects from plates to clocks; secondly, images by contemporary artists appeared exclusively in the homes of those professionally connected with the art world.Colin was born and brought up in Edmonton, London, the son of Ernest Painter, a policeman, and his wife, Nellie (nee Shepard). After leaving Latymer grammar school and graduating in fine art at St Albans, Colin took teaching posts while continuing his painting.In 1960 he married Anne Hotson, who collaborated with him on all his projects. Five years later he became course leader of a new creative arts degree at Northern Counties College (later Newcastle Polytechnic) in Newcastle. Alongside this he launched and edited a quarterly contemporary art journal, Aspects, whose contributors were mostly artists rather than critics, giving practitioners a forum for serious debate about their work. It ran for 10 years (1977-87), with contributors including Gilbert and George, Peter Fuller and Peter Blake.He left Newcastle in 1984 to take up the post of principal of Bath Academy as it moved into Bath College of Higher Education and in 1988 was appointed principal of Wimbledon School of Art in south-west London.After retirement in 1997, he and Anne moved to the village of Salvagnac in the Tarn valley in France. He devised several solo shows in association with regional councils, and sponsored an annual residency for recent graduates from Wimbledon School of Art. In 2008 the Mus?e Ingres in Montauban held a major retrospective of Colin¡¦s work. Colin and Anne moved back to London in 2017.An opening bat for Berkshire Gents, lifelong Spurs fan and centre-forward for CP¡¦s All-Stars, the football team he founded in Newcastle, Colin also loved music and was always ready to perform his grandfather Fred Holt¡¦s composition Chick Chick Chick Chick Chicken.He is survived by Anne, their children, Andy, Joe, Emme and me, and four grandchildren, Sophie, Lily, Phoebe and Kevin.',\n",
              " 'An environmental piece over 3km long, titled Axe Majeur (1980-ongoing), in the French town of Cergy-Pontoise, north-west of Paris; Passages (1990-94), a memorial to the philosopher Walter Benjamin in Portbou, Spain; Murou Art Forest (1998-2006) in Japan; and Way of Human Rights in Nuremberg, Germany (1989-93), are among the most celebrated works designed by the artist Dani Karavan, who has died aged 90.Karavan practised various art forms, including painting and drawing, stage-set design and wall reliefs, but it was environmental sculpture, a new medium that emerged in the 1960s and to which he contributed significantly, that brought him fame. He created more than 70 environmental pieces in Israel, Europe and east Asia, some of which became tourist attractions and pilgrimage sites.What they have in common is how the work affects the viewers. A visit to these sculptures moves the visitor physically and emotionally, generating an experience imprinted on the memory and often inspiring their own artistic creation. In High Maintenance ¡V the Life and Work of Dani Karavan (2021), a film by Barak Heymann, the German director Wim Wenders says: ¡§I love that in his work he leaves so much space for every viewer to dream himself or herself in it.¡¨Karavan¡¦s initial approach was key. ¡§I arrive at a site and the site speaks to me. I hear the site,¡¨ he said. His careful attentiveness resulted in his incorporating local elements from the urban or natural environment: trees and vegetation, stones, water and wind, sound, light and shade, as well as the history and memories of the place. He described one of his early works, the Negev Monument in the southern city of Beersheba (1963-68), as ¡§a sculpture that people could climb and walk on, touch, hear, smell and see. A sculpture using all the senses that constitute the experience.¡¨The son of Zehava and Avraham Karavan, Dani was born in Tel Aviv, a still small but fast-growing city in what was then British Mandate Palestine. He often mentioned the sand dunes that surrounded the city of his childhood as his early inspiration. His father, the city¡¦s chief gardener, designed many of its public spaces.In his youth Karavan studied painting with Marcel Janco in Tel Aviv and later in the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem under Mordecai Ardon. His early paintings reveal the sensibility to social and political injustice and human rights issues that would later become a major concern and lead him into peace activism. In 1948 Karavan and his friends in the youth movement Hashomer Hatzair founded Kibbutz Harel, where he lived until 1955. He then went to Florence to study fresco at the Accademia di Belle Arti, and to the Acad?mie de la Grande Chaumi?re art school in Paris.In the mid-60s Karavan created his first important public works, among them the wall relief Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem (1965-66) in the assembly hall of the Knesset, Israel¡¦s parliament, in Jerusalem and the Negev Monument.During the 50s and 60s he had designed stage sets for theatre and dance companies, among them the Israeli Batsheva company and the American Martha Graham company. This had a profound influence on his artistic perception. His environmental sculptures often function as stage sets where the visitors are actors ¡§choreographed¡¨ to move in and around the geometric and natural elements. This effect was first manifested in the Negev Monument, commissioned to commemorate the soldiers of the Negev Brigade who were killed in battle during the 1948 war of independence.Various shapes and structures made of concrete were scattered on a desert hilltop north of Beersheba, symbolically representing the fighter¡¦s world. Commemorating the dead, however, was not the only goal, as Karavan wrote years later: ¡§My aim was to create a site that people would enjoy visiting, spending time there in order to discover the place, and through it, to discover the landscape and themselves.¡¨In the 70s Karavan started exhibiting in Europe, taking part in the Venice Biennale in 1976 and Documenta 6 in Kassel in 1977. At a solo show in Florence in 1978, his abstract language crystallised into pyramids, towers and steps, with a blue laser beam running from the Belvedere fort to the cathedral dome. Following this show he was commissioned to produce the Axe Majeur in France, his most ambitious piece, started in 1980 and still ongoing.One of his most poetic and delicate works is the Sinti and Roma memorial in Berlin (2000-12), consisting of trees, sound, texts and a circular pond in the middle of which a fresh wild flower is placed every day. Currently the work is at risk due to a new underground line planned to pass directly beneath it. There are plans, too, to take over half of Karavan¡¦s Square of Culture (2005-13) in Tel Aviv for work on a railway line. Karavan was honoured with numerous awards and prizes and in 1995 was named the first Unesco Artist for Peace.In 1955 he married Hava Fogler. She survives him, along with their daughters, Noa, Tamar and Yael, and two grandchildren.',\n",

              " 'When encountering the little-known work of Hilma af Klint, you may find yourself asking some questions. ¡§It¡¦s out of time and out of place; it¡¦s almost miraculous,¡¨ says Sue Cramer, who co-curated a new exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. ¡§What is this work? Where did it come from? How did it get here?¡¨Born in 1862, the Swedish woman was one of the world¡¦s first abstract artists. Yet where the other founding fathers of 20th century abstraction ¡V the likes of Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich ¡V became indelible features of art history, af Klint has remained conspicuously absent, confined to its footnotes. In all likelihood, she is one of the most important pioneers you¡¦ve never heard of.While af Klint made some effort to display her work during the early 20th century, she later requested that her abstract paintings remain hidden until two decades after her death. She believed that the public of her time was not ready for the work and that an audience in the future might be.But her secret paintings would have to wait much longer than 20 years.Although the af Klint family unwrapped her work in the mid-1960s, it took five more decades for the artist to receive major institutional recognition, with a 2013 Moderna Museet exhibition in Stockholm, and a 2018-19 Solomon R Guggenheim Museum show in New York. The exhibition at the AGNSW, Hilma af Klint: The Secret Paintings, continues this new interest in the old work.The exhibition opens with a false expectation: two botanical watercolours. Where the rest of the show is abstract, bold and often towering in scale, the two quiet paintings ¡V one of a thistle, the other of a cucumber plant ¡V project a naturalism that exudes an almost staid restraint.Any number of more striking works from af Klint¡¦s sprawling oeuvre could have served as the exhibition¡¦s starting point, yet these humble pieces suggest how af Klint was framed during her lifetime: an artist trained in the classical traditions of Stockholm¡¦s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, her public practice characterised by conventional portraits and landscapes.Convention is banished in the next room. Here, af Klint¡¦s radical new mode of representation is unapologetically declared, as the recognisable world recedes and is replaced by a series of abstract works that traffick in the symbolic economy of spiritualism.By 1896 af Klint had joined with four of her female friends to form ¡§The Five¡¨: an occult group who met regularly to conduct seances and commune with spiritual beings. Inspired by these communions, af Klint was able to liberate her practice from past orthodoxy and push towards an entirely alien aesthetic.Cramer suggests that af Klint¡¦s spiritualism is one of the reasons her works failed to be taken seriously ¡V but it also carved a rare space for unbound female subjectivity.¡§She was working in a time when women were not allowed to be creative ... when they weren¡¦t supposed to make things that were new and radical,¡¨ Cramer says. ¡§In having a dialogue with spirits, she found her own voice as an artist. It opened a whole new realm that allowed her to be creative.¡¨Af Klint¡¦s most ambitious series, The Paintings for the Temple (1906-15), is comprised of 193 works that took almost a decade to make. Some of the series¡¦ most definitive pieces hang on the museum¡¦s walls ¡V including the aptly named The Ten Largest (1907).Reaching almost three and a half metres in height, these 10 paintings fill a room in the heart of the exhibition, while also completely filling a visitor¡¦s field of vision. Responding to the instructions of her spirit guides, af Klint¡¦s 10 abstract works track the slow development of humans: from childhood until old age. By contrast, each composition was painted over the course of four short days.The urgency and pace of this work finds expression in the compositions; they appear like freshly dried paintings rather than the artefacts of another century.Throughout the secular space of the museum, af Klint¡¦s works hum with a transcendent intensity. A range of religious and scientific iconography share space in her compositions. In The Dove series (1915) we see references to Christianity and the Holy Spirit but we also encounter a double helix, mathematical notations and zodiac signs. Af Klint pulls at seemingly disparate traditions, binding them together; her approach is catholic, rather than purely Catholic.The Paintings for the Temple series eventually culminates in af Klint¡¦s Altarpieces Group X (1915): a painted triptych whose gold leaf scintillates in the dark and animates the exhibition¡¦s grey walls. A bench rests in front of the work, offering a place to sit. Yet the furniture¡¦s silent invitation feels inappropriate ¡V the force of the work seems to demand that one kneel.The exhibition does not end in such grandiose terms. Instead, its coda comes in the form of two small, sensitive watercolour self-portraits. In a sense, this is nothing new. The whole exhibition represents another portrait of the little-known artist, whose work has finally found the future audience it deserves.',\n",
              " 'An artist whose work will no longer be available in the Royal Academy¡¦s gift shop after views she expressed in a blogpost were deemed transphobic has said she is considering legal action against the institution.The RA confirmed Jess de Wahls¡¦ embroidery work would no longer be stocked after a 2019 post ¡V in which she outlined her views on gender identity politics ¡V was determined to be transphobic by the RA.In a statement on Instagram, the RA said that De Wahls¡¦ previous comments, which included that she cannot accept people¡¦s ¡§unsubstantiated assertions that they are in fact the opposite sex to when they were born¡¨, were in conflict with its own diversity, equality and inclusion principles.De Wahls told the Guardian that she is considering legal action. ¡§I don¡¦t know yet, but something¡¦s going to give. They¡¦re gonna have to say something at some point. If they hope that this is just going to go away, it¡¦s not going to go away,¡¨ she said.The artist also refused to accept that denying trans women are women was transphobic, saying: ¡§There has to be place for people to disagree respectfully and not validating someone¡¦s felt identity, to me, I¡¦m sorry, that¡¦s not a hate crime.¡¨¡§I don¡¦t believe that a trans woman is a woman. I don¡¦t believe that¡¦s hateful, I think there¡¦s a space for everyone to exist.¡¨Veteran LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ¡§Trans women are different from other women, but being a different kind of woman is perfectly valid and no justification for the denial of their identity.¡§If an artist denied Jewish, black or gay people¡¦s identity, most people would say that the Royal Academy would be right to remove their works from the gift shop. But when Jess denies trans people¡¦s identity, she and other trans critics say that it¡¦s her right to free speech and she should not be penalised. This smacks of double standards.¡¨In the blogpost De Wahls, who is known for her feminist-inspired embroidery, discussed her own father¡¦s gender non-conforming self-expression, while expressing her concerns that gender politics have become too ¡§tribal¡¨.The blogpost also argued that gender politics had a detrimental impact on the rights of women and was similar to the constraints and censorship seen in De Wahls¡¦ birthplace in then East Germany.De Wahls believes the RA decision was influenced by an online campaign from activists, and said the call to no longer stock her work was made after the institution received eight emails complaining about her views.The RA did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian, but in its Instagram post the institution thanked those who had brought the statements to its attention. ¡§We appreciate you holding us to account on this issue, and we would like to reiterate that we stand with the LGBTQ+ community,¡¨ the statement read.Some commentators and campaigners have called the situation a ¡§test case for anti-discrimination laws¡¨ and a new form of ¡§McCarthyism¡¨, with De Wahls ¡V who is described on her own website as ¡§a bona fide lynch pin of the international textile arts scene¡¨ ¡V telling the BBC Radio 4¡¦s Today programme that the issue will not ¡§just go away¡¨.¡§I have the feeling that there is a hope within that institution, which is mind-boggling to me, that this just will go away,¡¨ she said. ¡§My inbox and the feedback I¡¦ve been getting from the general public is quite the opposite.¡¨There have been calls for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the matter and determine whether or not the RA¡¦s decision breaches the Equality Act.',\n",
              " 'Leading equal rights organisations in the UK have announced a landmark research commission into racial inequality in the art sector, as a new organisation called Black Lives in Music also aims to tackle racial inequality in the music industry.The Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank, and Freelands Foundation have partnered to deliver the first major commission into how black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students are excluded from art education.They hope the initiative will be a catalyst of structural change in the sector, where despite the success of individual artists such as Steve McQueen and Lubaina Himid, only 2.7% of the workforce come from a BAME background.In 2017, the Department for Education recorded that children in UK schools¡V of whom 31% were categorised as minority ethnic ¡V were introduced to visual art by teachers who were 94% white.The Runnymede Trust will deliver a two-year research programme and ask whether young people see their diversity reflected in the art industry and how this shapes their engagement. A sector-wide review, to be published in autumn 2021, will map the representation of people of BAME artists, curators and organisational leadership.It will also investigate art education in secondary schools and gather data around racial inequalities among students, teachers, and within the curriculum. It will focus particularly on key stages 3 and 4, when students are aged 11 to 16.Dr Halima Begum, the director of the Runnymede Trust, said: ¡§Our school students are a blank canvas. It is imperative they are able to see and appreciate diversity in art.

              " 'When Lacaton & Vassal were commissioned to redesign a public square in Bordeaux, their response was unusual. The French architects told the client to leave it alone. They thought the square was perfectly good as it was, and that public money would be better spent elsewhere.¡§When you go to the doctor,¡¨ said Jean-Philippe Vassal, ¡§they might tell you that you¡¦re fine, that you don¡¦t need any medicine. Architecture should be the same. If you take time to observe, and look very precisely, sometimes the answer is to do nothing.¡¨ In Bordeaux, the architects¡¦ diagnosis was that the square just needed some new gravel.Vassal and his partner, Anne Lacaton, have built a 30-year career on knowing how to intervene with the most economical of means, for which they have now been recognised with the Pritzker prize, architecture¡¦s highest honour. In an age of demolishing public housing and replacing it with shiny new carbon-hungry developments in the name of ¡§regeneration¡¨, Lacaton & Vassal have worked tirelessly to expand and upgrade existing buildings with surgical precision, transforming the lives of thousands of people in the process.From social housing to contemporary art centres, they always begin with a forensic assessment of what is already there, and how it could be improved with a minimum of resources. They prefer spreadsheets to slick computer-generated images, stretching shoestring budgets and using simple, off-the-peg materials with elegant economy, to ¡§make more and better with less¡¨. Their powerful rallying cry has become all the more urgent in light of the climate emergency: ¡§Never demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform, and reuse!¡¨It is a fitting moment for a prize once reserved for flamboyant sculptors of icons to be awarded to a practice that would prefer you didn¡¦t notice their presence at all. ¡§Lacaton & Vassal have proposed an adjusted definition of the very profession of architecture,¡¨ said the Pritzker jury. ¡§The modernist hopes and dreams to improve the lives of many are reinvigorated through their work that responds to the climatic and ecological emergencies of our time, as well as social urgencies.¡¨ Their architecture, it concluded, is ¡§as strong in its forms as in its convictions, as transparent in its aesthetic as in its ethics.¡¨The architects¡¦ fiercely pragmatic approach is most visible in their pioneering work on public housing in France, where they have transformed a number of blocks in Paris and Bordeaux, enlarging the flats and drastically improving their environmental performance. In the early 2000s, when the French state was allocating 167,000 for the demolition and rebuilding of each apartment, they argued that it was possible to redesign, expand and upgrade three flats of the same size for that amount. And they proved it.Working with Fr?d?ric Druot, they completely transformed the 1960s Tour Bois le Pr?tre in Paris in 2011, extending the floors of the tower block by three metres on all sides and wrapping the building with a new skin of glass, creating an insulating overcoat of covered balconies, or winter gardens. Miraculously, the residents could remain living there throughout the construction process ¡V no ¡§decanting¡¨ necessary.They used a similar strategy at the Grand Parc estate in Bordeaux, with Druot and Christophe Hutin, where three ailing council blocks were given a new lease of life in 2017. Once again, the flats were upgraded and extended with a second skin, some nearly doubling in size ¡V all for just 65,000 per home, about a third of the cost of demolishing and building anew.¡§Demolishing is a decision of easiness and short term,¡¨ said Anne Lacaton. ¡§It is a waste of many things ¡V a waste of energy, a waste of material, and a waste of history. Moreover, it has a very negative social impact. For us, it is an act of violence.¡¨Lacaton & Vassal take the same surgical approach to their cultural projects, too, creating poetry out of pragmatism, most successfully in the spellbinding form of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Here, over several years, they have carved out a beguiling sequence of gallery spaces from the shell of a palatial 1930s expo building, excavating a range of different rooms that makes visiting this contemporary art gallery feel like exploring an archaeological dig.In Dunkirk, they were charged with transforming a postwar ship-building factory into an arts centre. But they decided that the majestic ship hall was too powerful a space to fill with new floors of galleries, so they elected to build a ghostly doppelganger of the building right next door, using translucent materials to create the effect of an ethereal twin. The compelling void of the hall was left empty, creating a dramatic backdrop for performances and events.¡§Radical in their delicacy and bold through their subtleness,¡¨ in the words of Pritzker jury chair Alejandro Aravena, Lacaton & Vassal¡¦s new buildings are equally as inventive and sparing as their renovations. For a new architecture school in Nantes, they built an open three-storey concrete armature, kitted out with retractable polycarbonate walls and sliding doors, allowing multiple configurations of use, with all the floors connected by a wide sloping ramp. Their approach allowed them to provide almost double the space outlined in the brief for the same budget. ¡§Economy,¡¨ they said, ¡§is not a lack of ambition, but a tool of freedom.¡¨But their no-nonsense pragmatism doesn¡¦t always work in their favour, particularly when it comes to architectural competitions. While most architects present seductive images, Lacaton & Vassal prefer to submit line-drawn plans and financial tables. ¡§We don¡¦t know what the final result will look like,¡¨ said Vassal, ¡§and we¡¦re not going to pretend that we do.¡¨London recently lost out on two opportunities for its first Lacaton & Vassal project, in the form of competitions for the new Museum of London and Royal College of Art buildings, for which the French duo were shortlisted. Hopefully the Pritzker prize endorsement might help to convince the judges next time.',\n",
              " 'The National Portrait Gallery has pledged to significantly increase the number of women represented in its collection, with regard to both artists and sitters.On Wednesday it announced details of a three-year project to improve representation and dig out ¡§overlooked stories¡¨ of women who have helped shape British history and culture.The gallery said there was a lot of catching up to do, with only 25% of the portraits in the permanent collection being of women. Of the artists, 12% are women and 88% are men.Its historic building on Charing Cross Road is currently closed, undergoing a 35.5m top-to-bottom redevelopment. When it reopens in 2023 the walls will be noticeably more balanced, said Flavia Frigeri, the curator who is leading the project.She said there were many women in the collection who had not been properly researched until now. ¡§They might have made an important contribution to the war effort. They might have written treatises on mushrooms ¡K the range is quite vast.¡¨A second strand will be filling gaps by acquiring historic portraits of women who should be in the collection. Frigeri gave an example of Lilian Lindsay, the first British woman to qualify as a dentist. ¡§She is someone we should be celebrating; unfortunately we don¡¦t have her in the collection yet.¡¨Another example is the British constructivist artist Marlow Moss, whose work is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and in a number of Dutch collections including the Stedelijk in Amsterdam. She remains little known and poorly represented in the UK.The third aim is commissioning more portraits of contemporary women. ¡§I think it is vital that we make a greater effort to uncover the great stories that pertain to women.¡¨The project is a partnership with Chanel and is titled Reframing narratives: women in portraiture.The gallery said it would explore lives that should be better known, for example Ray Strachey, the painter of one of its Virginia Woolf portraits. Strachey¡¦s story has largely fallen through the gaps of history, but she played an important part in the suffrage movement as a key ally of Millicent Fawcett and was an energetic organiser for the National Union of Women¡¦s Suffrage Societies.Another fascinating artist to be better explored is Hannah Gluckstein, who adopted the genderless name Gluck in 1918 when she was in her early 20s. She is considered a trailblazer in gender fluidity and consistently broke gender norms, wearing masculine clothes, cutting her hair short and smoking a pipe. She is represented in the NPG collection with a striking self-portrait from 1942.The role of female photographers will be explored in greater depth, illuminating people such as Alice Hughes, a successful Edwardian photographer who only took pictures of women and children and at the peak of her career had about 60 female assistants.Researchers will also examine the contribution of women to the war effort in both world wars. Stories will include those of Georgina Masson, the first black female officer in the British army; Noor Inayat Khan, a British secret agent who operated in occupied France before she was captured by the Gestapo and executed; and Sarah Wilson, the first female war correspondent.The achievements of women are often overshadowed by men associated with them, such as Alma Reville, a pioneering film editor and screenwriter and the wife of Alfred Hitchcock.To mark Women¡¦s History Month, the gallery is releasing a series of filmed interviews with inspirational women including Sarah Gilbert, the lead scientist on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine; Kanya King, the founder of the Mobo awards; Amika George, a period poverty campaigner; and the actor Helena Bonham Carter.',\n",
              " 'In the remote Chinese village of Caizhai, a series of wooden pavilions step down a slope next to a babbling brook, their pitched tiled roofs echoing the rocky peaks of the mountains behind. Through big picture windows, day-trippers look inside, watching big barrels of soya make the journey from bean to tofu, passing through different rooms for soaking, grinding, pressing and frying, in a mesmerising parade of beancurd production.Caizhai has always been known as a centre of tofu. But, before this facility was built in 2018, families would produce small batches in their home workshops. They struggled to make ends meet, as the conditions didn¡¦t meet the food safety standards for the tofu to be sold in supermarkets, while the younger generation saw little incentive to stick around in the countryside and join ailing family businesses.Now, however, with a newly formed village co-operative running this purpose-built factory, they are processing 100kg of soybeans a day, supplying nearby schools and workers¡¦ canteens, and selling the improved product ¡V for almost double the previous price ¡V to retailers in the cities. Around 30 younger villagers, who had been lured away by metropolitan life, have returned to Caizhai to join the production team, and visitors have increased 20-fold. They are drawn by an increasingly widespread nostalgia for the countryside, to see traditional tofu-making in action and get a taste of village life, creating demand for further cafes, guesthouses and related businesses nearby.¡§We think of it as a kind of architectural acupuncture strategy,¡¨ says Xu Tiantian, the Beijing-based founder of DnA, the architecture practice behind the tofu factory and several other such projects across rural Songyang county in China¡¦s eastern Zhejiang province. ¡§In each case, we have tried to make something that restores the villagers¡¦ pride in their local identity, as well as bringing in visitors and creating a local economic network.¡¨Over the last seven years, she has been working with county leaders to build an impressive constellation of new facilities around the region, from a brown sugar factory and a camellia oil workshop, to a rice wine distillery and pottery production plant, along with community centres and museums. The projects have now been brought together in a handsome new book, which reads like the work of several practices over several decades, such is the dizzying speed of change in China.From a ring of bamboo trees tied together and pulled inwards to create an outdoor domed theatre, to a cave-like museum of Hakka culture made from rugged stone walls, the elegant collection of structures are all finely tuned to their setting. The projects mostly use simple local materials and traditional building techniques, updated to create a contemporary vernacular ¡V oozing a seductive rustic chic that helps to attract a growing crowd of cultured urbanites in search of a rural restorative. But it was an uphill struggle at first.¡§It was difficult to persuade some villagers about the value of using traditional methods, particularly in the more remote areas,¡¨ says Xu. ¡§Everyone wanted something modern and fancy, like they had seen in the big cities. Nobody believed in the old rammed-earth houses or bamboo structures any more.¡¨Gradually, she convinced them that careful repair and low-key intervention was better than bulldozing and then importing the ersatz glitz of the city. One of her first projects was restoring a cluster of rammed-earth houses in Pingtain village, which had been abandoned for decades, converting them into a community centre, with an indigo dye workshop and an exhibition space for agricultural equipment.On seeing the results, previously sceptical villagers were inspired to renovate their own buildings in a similar way, some setting up home-stay businesses. Xu¡¦s restoration of an old stone bridge between two villages included the installation of a simple wooden canopy and a grove of trees planted in the middle, transforming the route into a new social space for markets and events. For a new rice wine distillery in Shantou village, she built an enigmatic complex of black concrete vaults and perforated brick walls, echoing the form of historic wine cellars, once again arranged with a visitor route weaving between the production spaces. A forthcoming pottery factory will produce bottles for the wine, as well as packaging for the region¡¦s other products, helping to build a self-sustaining, co-operatively owned, rural economy across the county.¡§Songyang is an exemplar of what has become quite a widespread phenomenon,¡¨ says Shanghai-based design critic Aric Chen, currently researching a book about modern rural architecture in China. ¡§The last decade has seen a huge number of projects focused on eco-tourism and agri-tourism. It used to be about building boutique hotels, but the strategies have become much more sophisticated.¡¨The state-led ¡§preservation¡¨ of historic villages often used to entail wholesale demolition and reconstruction. Villagers were displaced, and their homes were transformed into restaurants and hotels to cater for coach-loads of domestic tourists, bussed in from the big cities for a glimpse of ¡§the past¡¨. Unesco-listed towns and villages became Disneyfied cadavers of their former selves, their earthen walls ¡§upgraded¡¨ with concrete and steel.The Songyang approach is much more subtle. The interventions stem from specific local industries in each village, and the projects are led by local unions, with funding coming from provincial and county-level subsidies, as well as the villagers themselves. Xu¡¦s strategic acupuncture acts as a catalyst for communities to build a future on their own terms, while also helping to close the yawning rural-urban divide. ¡§We¡¦re trying to provide a bridge between the villages and the city,¡¨ says Xu. ¡§Since we began, over 600 people have returned to Songyang to start new businesses, bringing their knowledge from the cities.¡¨The fate of the Chinese countryside has been under the spotlight in recent years, ever since president Xi Jinping declared the new national priority of ¡§comprehensive rural revitalisation¡¨. The past two decades of frantic city-building have led to ¡§rural hollowing¡¨, with almost 200 villages wiped off the map each day since 2000. Grandparents and babies were left behind by working-age adults flocking to the cities. The focus is now on creating incentives for a return. Ever keen to follow in Chairman Mao¡¦s footsteps, Xi has also urged everyone ¡V from teachers to artists and film-makers ¡V to live among the rural masses, in order to ¡§form a correct view¡¨. Meanwhile, the Communist Youth League has promised to dispatch more than 10 million students to the countryside by 2022, to ¡§spread civilisation¡¨.In parallel with state-sponsored initiatives, there has been a growing romantic longing for the rural homeland ¡V known as xiangchou ¡V among city-dwellers facing the pressures of urban life, with rising pollution and food safety concerns. Young tourists generally now prefer rustic retreats to the big resorts, while livestreaming from pastoral idylls has become a big business. Li Ziqi, a 30-year-old influencer from Sichuan province, has made millions from her personal food brand, promoted with videos of her foraging for wild herbs and pursuing traditional crafts, such as woodworking and natural dyeing. Her YouTube channel that has racked up more than 2bn views and she¡¦s not alone. Since mid-2019, more than 100,000 livestreamers have tuned in from rural farms to shift goods on Alibaba, the giant online marketplace.It is a form of cottagecore that has intoxicated the architecture world, too, with younger practices increasingly keen to ditch the city for the fields. ¡§It¡¦s a matter of opportunity,¡¨ says Chen. ¡§A lot of resources are being channelled into the countryside, and the smaller scale of projects make them easier for younger designers to get.¡¨ But, deeper than that, he thinks it aligns with longstanding questions about what contemporary Chinese architecture is, in a context where there were no private practices until the 1990s.¡§After an era of foreign architects using China as their playground,¡¨ he says, ¡§we¡¦re seeing a new generation of Chinese architects defining their own approach ¡V often using vernacular techniques in a new way ¡V and inspired by the processional principles of traditional Chinese garden design and landscape painting, creating a ¡¥social picturesque¡¦.¡¨With a large public housing project and a silk-farming workshop under way, the Songyang effect is keeping Xu and her team in hot demand. ¡§We¡¦ve received proposals from all over China,¡¨ she says. ¡§We¡¦re now working on a lotus tea factory in Guizhou and another rice wine factory in Shaanxi.¡¨ With around 940,000 villages across the country, there¡¦s going to be plenty to keep architects occupied for a while yet.',\n",
              " 'My friend Birtley Aris, who has died aged 93, was an artist who produced compellingly atmospheric images of landscapes, architecture and railways, usually in pen and often in response to poetry.Among his most arresting works were a series of large-scale drawings suggested by the poems of Edward Thomas (1985), his watercolours of Durham Cathedral and Hexham Abbey (1990 and 1992), and Storyville (2002), a celebration of jazz and one of several collaborations with the poet Linda France. He stood in the romantic tradition of Samuel Palmer and John Piper, but his work was distinctively his own: a windswept, snowy, beguiling vision of industrial-pastoral England.Birtley was born in Sunderland to Dorothy (nee Botcherby), a teacher, and Frederick Aris, a marine engineer. After attending Chester Road and West Park Central schools he went to Sunderland College of Art and Craft, but his studies were interrupted by the second world war, during which he became a Bevin Boy coalminer at the local Silksworth Colliery.After the war he worked for stained glass studios in Newcastle upon Tyne, London and Brighton, restoring church windows and creating war memorial windows. When that work came to an end he took up temporary work in London in the civil service, where he met Jean Robbins, an actor who was also temping at his workplace. They married in 1955 and in 1960 their daughter, Jo, was born. The family moved up to the north east of England in 1962, and after teacher training in Newcastle, Birtley taught art at Prudhoe High school in Northumberland from 1964 onwards, leaving to paint full time in 1982. In 2003 he began a series of large watercolours suggested by my poem The Railway Sleeper, followed by a joint book, Night Train (2008). He then established, with myself, Gerry Wardle and the poet Peter Bennet, a publishing imprint called Enchiridion, which gave light to various joint projects, including Bennet¡¦s Bobby Bendick¡¦s Ride (2010) and Birtley¡¦s graphic novel The Railwayman (2016).Covid delayed the publication of further completed works, but his final collaboration with France, Dwelling Place, was published in late 2020. Widely read, devoted to music, rich in friendship, Birtley was also a long-standing member of Amnesty International and the Labour party.Jean died in 2019. He is survived by Jo, and by his brother, David.',\n",
              " 'The woman in Leonardo da Vinci¡¦s life is finally getting her due. The new drama Leonardo, due to start on Amazon Prime on 16 April, drags Caterina da Cremona out of the shadows. Billed as his ¡§muse¡¨ and played by Matilda de Angelis from The Undoing, this forgotten woman of the Renaissance appears in publicity images deep in intimate dialogue with Aidan Turner as Leonardo. The show¡¦s writer Steve Thompson has explained her role in the show. ¡§Some of his relationships were with men; those were significant relationships,¡¨ he told Variety. ¡§But perhaps the most significant relationship in his life was with a friend who was a woman, with whom he was very close, and we unpack that.¡¨ Leonardo is framed as a murder mystery, and it claims to use this device to get at the reality of who the great Renaissance man was.But Caterina is a figment, a fantasy, a complete piece of tosh, invented by a 19th-century Romantic and for some reason given highly unconvincing credence by one modern biographer, Charles Nicholl.If the makers of Leonardo wanted a strong woman character, they had plenty of historical options. He clearly got on well with Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of the ruler of Milan, whom he portrayed holding a very phallic pet mink, perhaps to symbolise her power over men. He was also friends with Isabella d¡¦Este, ruler of Mantua and art connoisseur. Most fascinatingly, there was his encounter with one Lisa, wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. It¡¦s said he got musicians to play and entertained her with jokes when she posed for the painting we know as the Mona Lisa. What was it he found so mysterious about her? But no solid evidence exists that he ever had a romantic relationship with a woman ¡V either sexual or platonic.His reputation for loving men has never been hidden and the TV series does depict his replationships with men. Giorgio Vasari¡¦s book The Lives of the Artists, first published in 1550, suggests he was besotted with his male assistant Sala?, ¡§who was most comely in grace and beauty, having fine locks, curling in ringlets, in which Leonardo delighted¡¨. Gossip solidified into social history when documents were found at the start of the 1900s that show Leonardo was accused of ¡§sodomy¡¨ before Florentine magistrates in 1476.All the evidence is that men having sex was common in the art workshops of Renaissance Florence. The sodomy accusation against Leonardo was made to the fantastically named Office of the Night, a unique sex crime agency set up in 1432 to counter what was seen as a specifically Florentine vice. The records of the Office of the Night, brilliantly analysed by historian Michael Rocke, reveal that in Leonardo¡¦s day ¡§the majority of local males at least once in their lifetimes were officially incriminated for engaging in homosexual relations¡¨.As for Leonardo, he lived with his entourage of good-looking assistants and pupils, dressed them and himself in luxurious clothes including pink and purple tights, and drew stupendously sensual male nudes.But for some people that leaves something missing from his life. So his affair with a woman from Cremona was invented in the Romantic age. An Italian writer claimed to have seen a mention in Leonardo da Vinci¡¦s notebooks of his female lover called ¡§La Cremona¡¨. The passage is not in any of Leonardo¡¦s surviving notebooks. And even in the Romantic age, it didn¡¦t catch on.I am trying to understand why anyone would be desperate to dig up this slender story. Yet one of Leonardo¡¦s modern biographers, Charles Nicholl, tried to resuscitate it. Nicholl noticed a single word, ¡§Cremonese¡¨, in a list of names in Leonardo¡¦s papers in the Royal Collection and claimed it might mean La Cremona. Nicholl then speculates that Leonardo, who would have been 57 at the time, slept with this north Italian sex worker. He can¡¦t have painted female nudes without experiencing heterosexual love, he claims. It¡¦s as if Leonardo¡¦s homosexuality is incompatible with the universality of his art.Instead of being bedazzled by Turner and De Angelis, why not go to the National Gallery when it reopens and look at Leonardo¡¦s Virgin of the Rocks. The most hypnotic figure in it is an angel whose long curly hair matches Vasari¡¦s description of Sala? and whose tender pale face is magically androgynous. This angel is the most beautiful and most queer bit of painting in Britain. The Leonardo I want to see on screen is the man who painted this.',\n",
              " 'One of this year¡¦s Turner prize nominees has criticised the award¡¦s main sponsor, Tate, for its handling of sexual abuse accusations against a prominent donor and the redundancies it made in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.Black Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S) ¡V one of five collectives to be nominated ¡V released the statement via its Instagram account, saying they were grateful for the recognition but wanted to ¡§name some of the inconsistencies as we observe them¡¨.The group highlighted the treatment of the artist Jade Montserrat, who claimed she was ¡§banned¡¨ by Tate after she made allegations of sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour against the art dealer Anthony d¡¦Offay, who denies all accusations against him.¡§We understand that we are being instrumentalised in this moment,¡¨ the collective wrote. ¡§We ask ourselves: how can a BPOC queer collective of artists and cultural workers be nominated for the Turner prize whilst Black women artists continue to be silenced? Cases like Jade Montserrat¡¦s are not isolated in the art world.¡¨Tate suspended links with D¡¦Offay in January 2018 after the Observer revealed he was facing allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour dating from 1997 to 2004. He denies the claims.The gallery has since said it has severed all connection with D¡¦Offay. In a brief statement, it said: ¡§Tate and Anthony d¡¦Offay have agreed to end their relationship. This involves the return of works on loan to Tate from Anthony d¡¦Offay and Anthony d¡¦Offay Ltd and the removal of public signage at Tate.¡¨The collective also wrote about their concern over the redundancies made at Tate over the last 12 months. ¡§Over the last year, there have been strike actions at several art institutions, including the sponsor of the Turner prize, Tate, protesting the redundancies staff have been forced to take,¡¨ they stated.There have been two significant redundancy programs at Tate. The first was in August 2020, when it announced it was cutting half of its staff at Tate Enterprises Ltd, its commercial arm. In December, there was a second wave of job cuts, with 120 roles at risk among gallery staff as part of a 4.8m cost-cutting exercise.¡§It is not lost on us that the collective action of workers coming together to save their jobs and livelihoods was not adequately recognised by Tate,¡¨ the collective stated.The group ¡V which is one of five art collectives nominated alongside Array Collective, Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical, and Project Art Works ¡V was also critical of the turnaround time for the prize¡¦s accompanying exhibition. Work needs to be ready in time for a September opening in Coventry.B.O.S.S said this highlighted the ¡§extractive and exploitative practices¡¨ in prize culture and across the industry, where ¡§Black, brown, working class, disabled, queer bodies are desirable, quickly dispensable, but never sustainably cared for¡¨.Tate responded by saying it was committed to championing the work of artists and ¡§always welcome critical dialogue and engagement¡¨ and was delighted that B.O.S.S accepted the nomination.It added that because of the greater number of artists involved in the prize this year, all the shortlisted collectives are each receiving 10,000 for their participation, rather than the 5,000 given previously.An exhibition of the five collectives¡¦ work will run from 29 September, with the 25,000 winner announced at an award ceremony at Coventry Cathedral on 1 December.',\n",
              " 'The drive from London to a certain nameless valley in rural Oxfordshire - a preposterously pretty realm of flint cottages, quaint pubs, willow trees and gentle hills - is always slightly unnerving. This part of the country is so close to London and yet the feeling is of stepping back in time, a remoteness that is sudden and unexpected. But today the experience is all the stranger, for I¡¦m on my way to visit an institution I did not even know existed until a few days ago. Housed in a private museum whose location, hidden beneath farmland, I cannot reveal, the Sarikhani Collection is one of the most extraordinary and significant assemblies of art in Britain, if not the world. It comprises, in all its magnificence, some 1,000 items: ceramics, metalwork, textiles and manuscripts that together tell the long and wondrous story of Iran and its culture from 3000BC until the 18th century.The driving force behind this collection is Ina Sarikhani Sandmann, the warm and curious person who greets me when I finally arrive (there is no mobile signal and I twice get lost). Her passion for Iranian art is, as I¡¦m about to discover, disconcertingly infectious. Talk to her about an object for only two minutes and you will quickly be overcome by the feeling that you cannot possibly sit still until you¡¦ve seen this inlaid candlestick or that turquoise ewer; an exquisite 11th-century fragment of the Qur¡¦an written in a script called Eastern Kufic; a magnificent 400-year-old carpet on which, if you look carefully, you can see a bixie (a leonine animal) locked in combat with a qilin (in this case a type of deer with a dragon¡¦s face). She knows a lot, but she makes her expertise so accessible you hardly notice the learning involved, let alone the fact that you left home without having eaten any breakfast.Such a gift has its roots, perhaps, in the collection¡¦s beginnings. ¡§We went from being bumbling amateurs to initiating a full programme of education and exhibitions,¡¨ she says. ¡§But I like to think that we¡¦re still bumbling amateurs in a way, because then everything is possible, right?¡¨Her family¡¦s story is an old one: painful exile, followed by a lot of hard work and, finally, immense good fortune. Sarikhani Sandmann¡¦s German mother and Iranian father met in London as students in 1960 (¡§barefoot on the King¡¦s Road¡¨, as she likes to tell people). They married in Britain, she was born here and then her father took his family back to Tehran, where she spent her early childhood. ¡§My memories are idyllic, until the last year,¡¨ she says. ¡§We left during the revolution in 1979, when she was nearly nine with two suitcases, in the night, no papers. We were on UN refugee passports for the next eight years; it took us nearly two years to get leave to remain in Britain.¡¨ She looks around the room where we¡¦re sitting, which looks out on to a courtyard whose design is reminiscent of those you might see in Isfahan or Shiraz. ¡§This is beautiful,¡¨ she says. ¡§But my childhood was extremely modest. The first years were very difficult.¡¨Her father, who trained as an accountant, has what she describes as a ¡§driving entrepreneurial spirit¡¨. But he is also family-oriented and, though the family have never been able to go back to Iran, his and their connection with the country remained strong: ¡§A connection with its culture in its biggest sense. With its language, its food and its stories. My father is half Muslim and half Jewish, something that was rare in Iran, and we can trace his mother¡¦s family back 500 years.¡¨ In 2001, following a family tragedy, they began to wonder what, having been for so long on ¡§the treadmill of immigration, survival and work¡¨, life was really all about. ¡§We asked ourselves: what does it mean? How would we like to be remembered? What is involved in dying well?¡¨ And so the Sarikhani Collection was born. ¡§I always say that we never meant to do what we have done. It just got completely out of hand.¡¨They began by buying things from what we in the west would call the medieval period: the first half of the second millennium. Anxious about provenance, they bought from old American and European collections. ¡§Europeans have been buying Iranian art seriously for over 200 years,¡¨ she says. ¡§There is a huge legacy of trade and these objects are so beguiling. But very soon, it snowballed.¡¨ These days, nothing is off-limits. Where, in context, would she place the collection? How important is it? ¡§I would say¡K¡¨ ¡V she wrestles with embarrassment ¡V ¡§¡K it is a uniquely important collection. The vagaries of European art history have meant that art in Iran before the seventh century exists in the part of the museum called Ancient and Near East and Iranian art from later than that ie after the Arab conquest exists in a department called Islamic Art. Separated like this, a narrative thread is lost. We aim to reconnect that thread.¡¨The collection has an artist-in-residence programme and it is translating key academic texts from English into Farsi in conjunction with the National Museum of Iran, with which it has established links. ¡§These connections are really important,¡¨ she says. It is also deeply involved in the creation of the V&A¡¦s next major exhibition, Epic Iran, the first British show in 90 years to present the story of Iranian art and design from 3000BC to the present day. Not only has it lent many objects; Sarikhani Sandmann, as associate curator, has also overseen the last of its 10 sections, Modern and Contemporary Iran, which will cover the period from the 1940s onwards and will include work by, among others, Parviz Tanavoli, the country¡¦s most expensive living artist, and the late Shirin Aliabadi, whose photograph Miss Hybrid #3, in which a blue-eyed blonde in a headscarf blows a pink bubble with her gum as she nonchalantly tests government-decreed dress codes, will be a highlight (look closely: on her face is a plaster that speaks of a recent nose job).After we finish talking, she takes me into the purpose-built museum that houses the collection, its entrance signalled by tile work and ancient wooden gates. In the west, Iran is too often perceived as a black space, literally and metaphorically; unknown, sealed off, frightening. But here the country appears before you in full colour, the objects on display influenced by a multiplicity of cultures: Arabs, Greeks, Kurds, Jews, Zoroastrians, Azerbaijanis¡K Does she believe that the V&A¡¦s exhibition, years in the making, will change the way some think of Iran? She certainly hopes so. ¡§It¡¦s clear that there is a lot of misapprehension about it; that was true in the past and it is now. But it¡¦s a culture that has humungous depths and it continues to live and breathe and to have something relevant to say. I hope the show will help people to see the nuances, how vibrant it is.¡¨We look at some of the things that will soon be on their way to South Kensington: a bronze cast of a man and woman from 1500-1100BC that may be a votive object (the female figure, in her fringed dress and bangles, is completely delightful); a silver gilt rhyton, or drinking cup, from 200BC¡VAD100 in the shape of a lion so naturalistic that it might be about to spring right out of its glass case. But for me, the high point is, as it surely will be for many visitors to the V&A, Qaran Unhorses Barman, a watercolour from 1523-35, from one of the most splendid copies ever made of the Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, an epic poem by the revered Ferdowsi (according to legend, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni offered the poet a gold piece for every couplet he wrote). Under a moonlit sky, Iranian forces mount an attack on their Turanian enemies. In the picture, we see the moment when Qaran, the Iranian commander, forces his Turanian equivalent, Barman, from his horse. We see him flying from his saddle; in a moment, he¡¦ll lose his head. It¡¦s an amazing image. So much is going on ¡V armies are massed on each side of the picture ¡V and yet the eye is drawn irresistibly to the needle of Qaran¡¦s lance, which he has somehow managed to tuck inside Barman¡¦s belt.All the way home, I will think of its colours: the startling brightness of its turquoise and orange; the lapis blue of the sky, dotted with stars like diamond studs on a jeweller¡¦s velvet case. It is so lovely and I¡¦m lucky to have it to myself for a few long moments during which I am transfixed by the four standards the artist has allowed to fly and flutter just outside its gold border: a modern, almost witty touch that brings to mind a comic strip.Every blockbuster show is the biggest, the greatest, the most not-to-be-missed. We¡¦re inured to the hype by now. In the case of Epic Iran, however, I think it¡¦s hard to overstate its splendour and reach. Planned loans from Iran were not possible, thanks to worsening relations with Britain. But they¡¦ll hardly be missed. Three hundred objects will be on display, in 10 sections, many of them hitherto unseen by the public. ¡§We¡¦re hoping to give people a really good picture of a culture, from 3200BC to the present,¡¨ says John Curtis of the Iran Heritage Foundation, one of its curators (he has overseen the pre-Islamic part of the show). ¡§It has always been a kind of alien civilisation in the west, largely because classical authors painted a very unfavourable picture of it: democracy in Greece, a despot in the Orient, that kind of thing. This was the prevailing view in the 19th century and it still exists. Since 1979 when the Shah was deposed it has been very jaundiced. But I also think that people are hungry for information.¡¨Even the curators sound amazed by what they¡¦ve brought together. ¡§They¡¦re enormous!¡¨ says Tim Stanley, a curator in the V&A¡¦s Middle Eastern collection, of three 10-metre-long paintings that reproduce tile work patterns on the interiors of domes in Isfahan, the city that became Iran¡¦s capital in 1598 (newly restored for the show, they were commissioned by the V&A in the 1870s, when the museum acquired many reproductions of global architecture). Stanley recalls his surprise as he and his colleagues unrolled these remarkable facsimiles in a store in Battersea and his excitement when he understood what they were: ¡§They¡¦ve been in storage for a century and may not ever have been displayed before.¡¨What¡¦s his favourite thing in the exhibition? He doesn¡¦t hesitate. ¡§The star for me is a manuscript page from the poem Humay and Humayun. It¡¦s just¡K astonishing.¡¨ The picture, from 1396, shows Prince Humay¡¦s first encounter with Humayun, the daughter of the emperor of China, whose hand he will win in spite of her father¡¦s hostility. ¡§The setting is so complex,¡¨ says Stanley. ¡§She¡¦s on a balcony of her palace, which looks over a beautiful garden; he¡¦s on his horse below, looking up. A couplet from the poem is dropped in. It talks of ¡¥the moon at the edge of the roof¡¦, which is her face, and ¡¥the evening plaited around it¡¦, which is her dark hair. The text tells you where the centre of the painting is and that¡¦s the gaze between them.¡¨Those living Iranian artists whose work will be on display are also excited. ¡§I am honoured,¡¨ Tanavoli tells me, in an email. ¡§It¡¦s a good feeling, to be in the company of my ancestors; to have such noble and civil lineage.¡¨ Tanavoli, who was born in 1937, is best known for his fluid, sculptural representations of heech, the Farsi word for ¡§nothing¡¨. But at the V&A, visitors will be able to see his The Poet and the Beloved of the King, a construction of 1964-6 in which Farhad, the architect hero of the Khamsa of Nizami, a series of narrative poems, snares his beloved Queen Shirin (Tanavoli¡¦s is a daringly comical representation of the story, a fierce red arrow on Farhad¡¦s body indicating his sexual excitement). ¡§It was clever of the V&A to choose this piece,¡¨ he says. ¡§The story of Shirin and Farhad is one of the most popular love stories in Iran and Iran is the land of great love stories.¡¨Tanavoli¡¦s response is oblique when I ask whether Epic Iran will change outsiders¡¦ perceptions of the country. ¡§The language of art is way more efficient than any of the pronounced languages and, due to its incorruptibility, it is one that people trust,¡¨ is all he will say. But others are more explicit ¡V and happy to be so. ¡§My pictures are often to do with how east and west see one another,¡¨ says Khosrow Hassanzadeh, on the line from Tehran. ¡§They ask the question: are we Iranians all terrorists?¡¨ The V&A will show his self-portrait Khosrow, from 2007-8, an image that at first sight looks pretty kitsch, adorned as it is with plastic flowers and a curtain of fairy lights. But its meaning is serious, because it harks back to an earlier portrait called Terrorist: Khosrow. Which is the real Khosrow, the artist asks. After all, in both images, the same gentle-looking man can be seen lovingly holding a portrait of his grandfather.Hassanzadeh, who was born in 1963 and is from a working-class Azerbaijani family, was a conscript in the Iran-Iraq war and he likes to joke ¡V he is a very smiling person ¡V that it was this experience that made him into an artist: it was, he says, only by offering to make paintings of Iran¡¦s martyrs during the war that he avoided martyrdom himself. As an artist ¡V he went to university after the war ended in 1988 ¡V he has always wanted to make work whose themes encompass the things no one in Iran likes much to talk about, even as his paintings and installations play on images of Islamic shrines and cemeteries. His view of post-revolutionary Iran, something the contemporary section of the V&A¡¦s exhibition explores at an angle, may be surprising to some. ¡§Sure, there are limits on our freedom,¡¨ he tells me. ¡§But the revolution made an opportunity for me. Before, it was only the rich who could go abroad to study art. It opened things up, in that way.¡¨ What does he feel about his imminent appearance at the V&A? ¡§I¡¦ve been in lots of international exhibitions,¡¨ he says, rattling off a list. ¡§But I¡¦m still very happy and proud to be in this one. We have so much to show to the rest of the world.¡¨',\n",
              " 'A robotic arm twitches above a lumpy landscape of compacted earth, pock-marked with little hollows from which pink tufts of fungus emerge. This is an ¡§ecosystem of empathy and coexistence¡¨, a caption tells us, the fungal flora and mechanical limb living together in perfect harmony. Nearby, bubbling tanks of lurid green algae are apparently busy cultivating an ¡§urban microbiome¡¨, while a cloud of feathery acrylic creatures hover above a mysterious constellation of columns emitting an eerie hum.Welcome to the Venice Architecture Biennale, pandemic edition, an exhibition as confusing as it is confused. All along the 300-metre length of the main exhibition in the city¡¦s former rope-making factory, and filling every room of the labyrinthine central pavilion in the Giardini nearby, are installations attempting to answer the momentous curatorial question: ¡§How will we live together?¡¨ In the current context of the climate emergency, changing family structures, the refugee crisis, political polarisation, the Black Lives Matter movement, and, now, Covid-19, the theme could not be more urgent. Yet very few participants seem willing to even attempt an answer.¡§We can no longer wait for politicians to propose a path towards a better future,¡¨ declares this year¡¦s curator, Hashim Sarkis, a Lebanese architect and dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ¡§As politics continue to divide and isolate, we can offer alternative ways of living together through architecture.¡¨His pitch is compelling, and his manifesto full of good intentions and provocations, which makes the half-baked conceptual posturing on show even more frustrating. In a muddled pick¡¦n¡¦mix of arcane academic research, the show jumps from moon rocks to migration, biotech to bird boxes, showcasing architects¡¦ voracious appetite for tackling territories beyond buildings, with often dubious results.Scented rocks in a glass case provide a memorial for extinct flowers, while a dripping ceiling is supposed to make us think about the Alps. There is a booming metal box, simulating the sound of cracking icebergs in Antarctica, and a shower of dangling chunks of obsidian, in an allegory for the Anthropocene. But there is very little in the way of concrete spatial proposals addressing how our cities and habitats might be rethought for a more equitable future. Instead, we are offered a series of projects that use global crises as the inspiration for installation art (or what architects like to call ¡§research¡¨), each served up with a generous garnish of inedible word salad.Patience is occasionally rewarded with a few kernels of wheat amid the chaff. Palestinian-Italian group DAAR present a provocative film about their attempt to recognise the Dheisheh refugee camp as a Unesco world heritage site. Located just south of Bethlehem in the West Bank, the camp was established in 1949 to serve 3,000 people, and is now home to around 15,000, with an active civil society. Exploring the idea of ¡§stateless heritage¡¨, they question who has the right to nominate sites, what such a designation would mean for the refugees¡¦ legal right of return, and how to value the heritage of a culture in exile. Recent events make their decade-long work even more compelling.In a room nearby, another Bethlehem-based practice, AAU Anastas, present their latest experiment in structural stone vaulting, reviving centuries-old masonry traditions with modern milling techniques. Developed for a new arts centre in Jordan, the interlocking stone jigsaw pieces create an undulating ceiling of different heights, with the arrangement of columns defining a range of spaces below ¡V used as a stage for a passionate performance by the Sonic Liberation Front during the opening.There are some witty contributions elsewhere, like the satirical Catalog for the Post-Human by US-based British duo Parsons & Charlesworth, which imagines a future when gig-economy workers are forced to augment themselves to stay competitive. Their intravenous infusion suit, designed to pump a continuous cocktail of nutrients and electrolytes into workers¡¦ veins, is particularly bleak.This year¡¦s national pavilions are the usual mixed bag, mostly deviating from the theme to show whatever they want, but with some interesting results. For once the US contribution is a triumph. Curated by Chicago-based architects Paul Andersen and Paul Preissner, it charts the ubiquity of timber framing in American construction, from 19th-century warehouses to over 90% of US homes built today. Easy, cheap and infinitely flexible, it is America¡¦s biggest contribution to architecture, yet, the curators argue, it has been entirely overlooked. An elegant series of models are complemented by an enormous climbable structure erected in front of the neoclassical pavilion, providing elevated views across the park.Wood also looms large in the Finnish contribution next door, which unpicks the fascinating social history of the country¡¦s phenomenally successful Puutalo flat-pack housing system. Established in 1940 to address the Karelian refugee crisis, when some 420,000 people were displaced by war, the factory-built homes became one of the country¡¦s biggest exports, shipped to more than 30 countries, from Israel to Colombia, where many of the distinctive bungalows still stand. Striking documentary photographs show how they have been adapted and personalised over the years.The Japanese have shipped an everyday wooden house to Venice, too, although, rather than reconstructing it, they have arranged the disassembled pieces around their pavilion, creating a wabi-sabi salvage yard, alongside historical photos of the home¡¦s domestic life over the decades. Italian craftsmen have transformed some of the fragments into pieces of furniture and other structures in the grounds around the pavilion, in a process of poetic upcycling. Given the embodied carbon of new construction, such nimble re-use will be evermore crucial.The British pavilion, curated by Manijeh Verghese and Madeleine Kessler, tackles the testy topic of privatised public space, with six different practices variously examining the pub, the high street, common land and the gated garden. It¡¦s a worthy topic, but the whimsy of the execution distracts from what could have been a powerful polemic. There are some nice touches in the set-dressing, such as a Ministry for Common Land wallhanging designed like a trade union banner, a spherical pink climbing frame (sadly no climbing), and a couple of Wetherspoon¡¦s carpets framed on the wall. But overall it falls into the usual trap of too many hands, with little of substance behind the fun props.The biennale is a useful reminder that professional curators exist for a reason, and that architects, for all their other skills, might not be best equipped to do it. So coming to the contribution by the V&A, right at the end of the sprawling Arsenale, is a breath of fresh air, organised with the clarity and confidence of a museum show.Taking the British mosque as its subject, it features 1:1 reconstructions of parts of three archetypal London mosques, from the former Protestant chapel and synagogue of the Brick Lane mosque, to the Old Kent Road mosque housed in a former pub, to Harrow Central mosque, which used to be in a converted terrace house. Recreated with forensic precision, the stage sets tell a beautiful story of ad-hoc adaptation, documenting a particular moment of grassroots, self-built places of worship, reflecting the humble majority of the 1,800 mosques in Britain, carved out of old shops, cinemas and pubs. Developed by architect and writer Shahed Saleem, and curated by the V&A¡¦s Ella Kilgallon and Christopher Turner, the exhibition includes video interviews, photographs and 3D lidar scans of the mosques, providing a colourful snapshot of the stories behind these often temporary spaces.It throws much of the rest of the biennale into stark relief. Like the invisible hand of a good editor, you only realise the importance of a judicious curator when it¡¦s not there.',\n",

              " 'In another example of the high cost and reputational risk involved in governance scandals, Goldman Sachs announced on Friday that it has reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the government of Malaysia to resolve the proceedings in the country against the bank in the 1MDB case.1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) is a state-owned investment fund created to pursue projects for the economic benefit of the country and its people. In 3 bond offerings executed by Goldman Sachs between 2012 and 2013, the fund raised approximately 6.6 billion for 1MDB, a substantial portion of which was allegedly stolen by people with control over the fund and Malaysian government officials. In a settlement last year with former Goldman Managing Director and ?Chairman of South East Asia Tim Leissner, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission outlined its findings regarding executive¡¦s involvement in the scandal, and the fees the bank earned from the deals, including:¡§As part of the scheme, Leissner and others bribed government officials in Malaysia and in Abu Dhabi to obtain and retain lucrative business for Goldman Sachs, including the 2012 and 2013 bond deals, from which Goldman Sachs earned approximately 600 million.¡¨The SEC findings also revealed that Leissner and others concealed from the bank his relationship with, and involvement in the deal of Malaysian intermediary Jho Low, now alleged to have stolen billions from the fund. According to the findings:¡§Leissner selectively concealed from other employees of Goldman Sachs, including the GS Committees and their members, that he was working with Low as an intermediary to secure the deals. Leissner did this in an effort to avoid potential heightened scrutiny of the bond deals by the GS Committees, the Compliance Group or the Intelligence Group.¡¨In the new settlement, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay the Government of Malaysia 2.5 billion, and provided a guarantee that the government will receive at least 1.4 billion in proceeds from assets related to 1MDB seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for resolving all criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm and its current and former directors, excluding Leissner and Roger Ng, who worked with Leissner. Goldman still faces other pending investigations in the matter, including with the U.S. Department of Justice.In a statement released following the announcement of the settlement, Goldman pledged to learn and improve from the experience, though the bank did not provide specific actions it would take in this direction:¡§We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve outstanding charges and claims against Goldman Sachs. Today¡¦s settlement is an important step towards putting the 1MDB matter behind us and will help enable the Malaysian government to move forward with additional recovery efforts and to execute on its economic priorities.

              " 'In a campaign launched today by CDP, a group of 137 financial institutions representing assets of nearly 20 trillion is urging 1,800 of the most high-emitting global companies to set science-based emission reduction targets towards achieving a net zero future.CDP is one of the founders of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), along with the World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. To date, over 1,000 companies globally have pledged to align their decarbonization plans with the Paris Agreement by adopting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, and slightly over 450 companies have had their targets approved by SBTi.Emily Kreps, Global Director of Capital Markets at CDP, said:¡§The importance of investor engagement to drive sustainable corporate action cannot be overstated. Climate change presents material risks to investments, and companies that are failing to set targets grounded in science risk losing out ¡V and causing greater damage to the world economy.¡§As the interest in this campaign shows, investors want to see accelerated corporate commitment that reflects the unprecedented challenge the planet faces. To make this possible, they expect companies to commit fully to ambitious targets grounded in science. With business resilience and adaptation to systemic risks exposed by the recent public health crisis, the tide is rapidly turning against companies not taking note of investor demands.¡¨The companies targeted under the new campaign are the source of 13.5 Gt of emissions each year, in just their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, equivalent to 25% of total global emissions. According to CDP, across their entire value chains, the companies have influence over 3x this volume of cumulative emissions.Several members of the investor group explained that they increasingly look to avoid climate risk, and invest in companies that are well-positioned for the coming energy transition. Setting science-based targets for emissions reductions are seen as one of the key steps expected for their portfolio companies.Ted Maloney, Chief Investment Officer at MFS Investment Management, said:¡§As an active investment manager we allocate capital to companies that we believe can outperform throughout an economic cycle. Companies that do not set science-based targets risk being surprised by increased costs or lost business that could result from the increasing focus on climate change by society and regulators. We need companies to rigorously evaluate the ways in which their businesses need to change to keep global warming below a 2-degree increase. Science-based targets not only encourage this kind of rigor and critical self-evaluation, but also enable institutional investors to better serve their clients through improved analysis.¡¨Hiroki Tsujimura, Chief Investment Officer at Nikko Asset Management, said:¡§Nikko AM is committed to integrating ESG into its investment management processes, but this is only possible with strong commitment and transparent disclosure from companies, and the willingness of senior management to engage with investors. We hope this campaign will signal that investors are serious about climate issues, and emphasize the importance and urgency of creating a forward-looking science-based target, integrated with long-term corporate strategies.¡¨Jean-Jacques Barb?ris, Director of the Institutional and Corporate Clients division & ESG at Amundi, said:¡§The adoption of emission reduction targets by corporates is a critical factor of capital mobilization. Responsible investors want to invest in companies that are transitioning to a Paris-aligned economy. Science-Based Targets represent a global, robust and helpful tool to support companies on their transition journey. Limiting global warming requires collective response; corporate actions and investors¡¦ mobilization to decarbonize portfolios go hand-in-hand. Supporting CDP for this important initiative is part of our broader engagement to support climate action¡¨.CDP stated that while companies can set science-based targets at any point throughout the year, investors will be engaging with companies until May 2021, when the impact of the campaign will be evaluated.',\n",

              " 'Leading up to the UN Climate Summit, COP26, a major group of 587 investors, representing 46 trillion in assets, has issued a call on global governments to implement a set of actions geared towards helping mobilize investments to address the climate crisis, including outlining roadmaps to decarbonize emissions-intensive sectors and implementing mandatory climate disclosures.In a statement developed by The Investor Agenda, a collaboration of sustainable investment focused organizations,* the investors urge global leaders to raise their countries¡¦ climate ambitions and implement policies. The statement explains that investors are seeking to decrease their climate risk exposure and invest in opportunities to benefit from the net zero transition, yet the ability to properly allocate the trillions of dollars needed to facilitate the global transformation is limited by the current state of government commitments.In the statement, the investors said:¡§Strong policies, in line with limiting global warming to no more than 1.5-degrees Celsius, can accelerate and scale up private capital flows towards the net-zero transition. Full implementation of the Paris Agreement will create significant investment opportunities in clean technologies, green infrastructure and other assets, products and services needed in this new economy.¡¨The investors set out five priority actions for governments. These include strengthening 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to align with limiting warming to 1.5-degrees Celsius; committing to domestic mid-century net-zero emissions targets, including interim goals and decarbonization roadmaps for carbon-intensive sectors; implementing policies to deliver on climate targets, such as carbon pricing, phasing out thermal coal-powered electricity generation, and removing fossil fuel subsidies; ensuring that COVID-19 economic recovery plans support the transition to net-zero emissions, and; committing to implementing mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements aligned with TCFD recommendations.The statement also highlights the opportunities for countries that implement the recommended targets and policies, and the dangers for those who lag:¡§While we recognize the differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities of countries, we believe that those who set ambitious targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions, and implement consistent national climate policies in the short-to-medium term, will become increasingly attractive investment destinations. Countries that fail to do so will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage',\n",

The index is designed to help investors make decisions based on a country¡¦s progress towards gender equality.The new index ranks 29 countries, scoring them on a scale out of 100 based on the following factors: ¡§The current economic situation for women, the policies in place to support equality, plus an ¡¥empowerment¡¦ score that measures how much business and political opportunity and involvement there is for women.¡¦¡¦The index also highlights the reasons for inequality and it can be improved for each specific country.ASI has found insightful information about the ongoing female inequality in the 29 countries, including the fact that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, female representation in state and political jobs has decreased and access to business opportunities had also fallen. The UK and Japan have both ranked low on the list, and are facing a lack of positive female empowerment figures, political representation, and less business opportunities for women.According to the global asset manager, the US, which ranks 27th out of 29, could promote gender equality by passing pro-equality policies that encourage maternity and paternity leave, less-expensive childcare, and lighter taxing on parents and single parents.The countries that rank higher of the list are Spain, the Nordic countries, Germany, and Estonia. According to ASI, women in those countries are well represented and have better opportunities across all economic, policy and empowerment indicators.?Stephanie Kelly, Deputy Head of the Aberdeen Standard Investments Research Institute (ASIRI), said:¡§The aim is to identify the economies likely to benefit from greater gender equality, because they will have better economic outcomes and could offer better investment opportunities. This is our first year of creating the index, so it will be really interesting to see how countries improve or if the pandemic, for example, sets gender equality back.¡¦¡¦¡¥¡¦The very specific measures we have used make it easy for investors to see what can be improved and where. This will also make it easy to track improvements or steps backward in subsequent years. The index takes three particular areas into account in the scoring: the economic macro fundamentals of every country, the policies concerning gender equality, and an ¡¥empowerment¡¦ scoring system. We want to grow the understanding that gender equality really is fundamental for a country¡¦s growth and development. Hopefully, we can also highlight where a country needs to make improvements.¡¨',\n",

The launch of our sustainable indexation range is a natural extension of our market-leading indexing capability and, while there are a growing number of sustainable equity indices to choose from, we felt there was a gap in the market as many index designs tend to be highly specific in their purpose.

              " 'Investors are turning to financial advisors and wealth managers for advice on ESG investments, according to global professional services firm Accenture¡¦s new report, ¡§The New State of Advice.¡¨For the report, Accenture surveyed 1,000 demographically diverse investors across the U.S. and Canada, who have a financial advisor, regarding their financial advice needs, including the types of advice they want, and who they trust to deliver it.Accenture found that nearly sixty percent of investors have asked for advice on ESG investments, and 84% plan to purchase an ESG product in the next year.The report indicated that while wealth managers have improved in areas including providing an advice experience that spans multiple consumption methods, growing investor demand for ¡¥holistic¡¦ advice that considers their sustainability and social responsibility demands, among others, is driving a need for less generic and more tailored investment advice. The report found, for example, that 55% of respondents, and almost 90% of mid-high net worth investors felt that the advice provided to them by their advisor was too generic.The report carries a clear message for wealth managers and financial advisers on the need to improve in key areas. As investors indicated that the advice they currently receive is too generic, 55% also reported that they believed they could do a better job investing themselves, and 69% said they would consider using Google, Apple or Facebook if they offered wealth products and services.According to the report, the demand for ESG investment advice is strongest among younger investors. While 59% of respondents overall reported having asked their advisors about ESG or socially responsible investments, the responses were substantially stronger with Generation Z investors (typically defined as under 25 years old) at 80%, and Millennials at 63%, compared to Baby Boomers at 27%.Rachel Silver, Managing Director in Accenture¡¦s North America wealth management group said:¡§The days of tailoring the level of service to fit the size of an investor¡¦s portfolio are over; the average investor expects the same level of service and personalization as someone in the high-net-worth bracket.

The report indicated a strong link, with companies that embed effective ESG practices generating more than 20% higher profitability on average.The report also found, however, that while most organizations express intentions towards improving their sustainability profiles, the conversion of this expression into action often lags, either due to a lack of perceived financial benefit, with executives concerned that improvements in ESG are ¡¥zero-sum,¡¦ indicating a trade-off with profitability, or due to difficulties implementing sustainable business practices. The report cites recent Accenture studies, for example, that found that while 73% of executives identify ¡§becoming a truly sustainable and responsible business¡¨ as a top priority, 43% of companies fail to match their ESG rhetoric with results.In order to distinguish organizations that can effectively transform sustainability intentions into effective stakeholder-centric changes and practices, Accenture and WEF identified a set of 21 management practices, systems and processes that form an organization¡¦s ¡§Sustainability DNA.¡¨ The management practices encompass a broad range of categories, from performance & reporting and risk management to environmental & quality standards and executive compensation, and begin with the key elements of responsible leadership, including Shareholder Inclusion, Emotion & Intuition, Mission & Purpose, Technology & Innovation, and Intellect & Insight.Peter Lacy, Chief Responsibility Officer and Global Sustainability Services lead, Accenture, said:¡§The world¡¦s environmental and social challenges are already disrupting business today.

Those who ignore this moment to position for the future risk being left behind.¡¨To assess Sustainability DNA, Accenture and WEF created the Sustainable Organization Index (SOI), ranking nearly 4,000 companies on their ESG supporting practices. According to the report, companies in the top quartile of the SOI had EBITDA margins 21% higher than bottom quartile companies (19.6% vs 16.2%), as well as significantly higher total shareholder return and ROIC.The report advocates a series of steps ¡V Diagnose, Define, Develop ¡V that organizations can take in order to improve their Sustainability DNA, including assessing areas where performance is stronger and where improvement is needed, identifying key interventions needed to meet the organization¡¦s sustainability goals using a variety of different inputs, and building a roadmap based on the organization¡¦s vision for change with a clear set of KPIs to measure success.Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum, said:¡§By investing in organizational practices that stick, businesses will be better placed to achieve their financial goals while contributing to social welfare and the common good.¡¨',\n",

              " 'A new survey released by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) reveals an increasing move by investors away from climate risk, and towards net zero investment opportunities. The report also indicates increasing sophistication by investors in their integration of climate strategies in the investment process, while highlighting key barriers to more complete integration.The AIGCC was launched in 2016 as part of the Global Investor Coalition, a group of regional climate change investor groups providing a global platform for dialogue between investors and governments on climate policy, facilitating corporate engagement on climate risk, and supporting increased low carbon investment. The organization is aimed at creating awareness among Asia¡¦s asset owners and financial institutions about the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and low carbon investing. For the new study, the AIGCC surveyed regional asset managers and asset owners, including insurance firms, government pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, representing over 1.9 trillion in assets under management, in November and December 2020.The survey found clear evidence of an increased investor appetite for climate solutions, with approximately 90% of Asian frontier and emerging market investors, as well as developed market investors reporting actively deploying climate aligned or low climate investments, compared with fewer than 60% of emerging markets and slightly over 70% of developed market investors surveyed in 2019.Similarly, implementation of climate aligned strategies is growing rapidly, with nearly 70% of respondents using decarbonisation strategies, up from less than 30% in 2019, and almost half utilizing a portfolio tilting strategy, an increase of more than 35%.Investors are also becoming more sophisticated in their approach to climate investment strategies and risk management. For example, 79% of investors in listed equities and 74% in fixed income reporting ?conducting carbon footprint analysis on assets, compared with only 19% and 11% in 2019, respectively. Investors are also increasingly using a broader range of methodologies to define green or climate aligned investments, including the EU Taxonomy, building and infrastructure related standards, and the China NDRC¡¦s guiding catalogue, among others, and relying less on third party ESG data providers.Other key findings of the survey include:Reporting. 50% of respondents report already disclosing against the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, with another 30% actively considering it.Corporate engagement. Investors are becoming increasingly active on climate engagement, with 70% reporting using corporate engagement strategies on climate, compared to roughly half of respondents in 2019. Investors are increasingly participating in global collaborative engagement initiatives such as Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative.Barriers. The most common barrier reported to increasing exposure to low carbon or green investments is a lack of tools to measure green impact, followed by a lack of opportunities with appropriate risk-return objectives, and a lack of a clear definition of low carbon or green investments.AIGCC Executive Director, Rebecca Mikula-Wright said:¡§The survey results should send a clear signal to Asian policymakers. If you create investable opportunities there is significant private capital interested in supporting and accelerating the transition to net zero emissions.¡¨¡§This latest survey shows that Asian investors are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to climate risk and are better positioning themselves to take advantage of the opportunities in the inevitable transition to net zero emissions.¡¨Mikula-Wright added:¡§Overall, the trends captured in this survey indicate that Asian investors are moving in the right direction on climate change. We know that once Asia gets going it won¡¦t be long until it overtakes rest the of world.¡¨',\n",
