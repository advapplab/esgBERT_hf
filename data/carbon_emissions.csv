Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2081,The importance of this issue is underscored by the advances in scientific research during the past few years.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2082,These findings make clear both that the average temperature on the planet has risen by 1 degree Celsius during the past 50 years and that carbon dioxide emissions have been a primary driver of this and this temperature increase.,

Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2085,A big part of the challenge is that as a society we have not committed sufficiently to reduce emissions.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2086,"One conclusion we've reached is that we all need to learn – and get real – about ""carbon math.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2087,"This is the basic mathematical concepts that are important to understanding how the carbon issue applies to each of us, whether as individuals, families, businesses, or other organizations.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2088,One aspect of this is relatively simple but quite important.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2089,"Scientists account for carbon emissions by classifying them into three categories, or ""scopes.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2090,"Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions that your activities create — like the exhaust from the car you drive, or for a business, the trucks it drives to transport its products from one place to another or the generators it might run.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2091,"Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come from the production of the electricity or heat you use, like the traditional energy sources that light up your home or power the buildings owned by a business.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2092,"Scope 3 emissions are the indirect emissions that come from all the other activities in which you're engaged, including the emissions associated with producing the food you eat, or manufacturing the products that you buy.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2093,"For a business, these emission sources can be extensive, and must be accounted for across its entire supply chain, the materials in its buildings, the business travel of its employees, and the full life cycle of its products, including the electricity customers may consume when using the product.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2094,"Given this broad range, a company's scope 3 emissions are often far larger than its scope 1 and 2 emissions put together.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2095,This makes clear that we need to measure all three of these scopes.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2096,"At Microsoft, we expect to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2097,"Of this total, about 100,000 are scope 1 emissions and about 4 million are scope 2 emissions.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2098,The remaining 12 million tons all fall into scope 3.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2099,"Given the wide range of scope 3 activities, this higher percentage of the total is probably typical for most organizations.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2100,There's another aspect of carbon math that's also essential.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2101,"This is the difference between being ""carbon neutral"" and being ""net zero.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2102,"While they sound similar, in fact they're different.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2103,"Given common usage, companies have typically said they're ""carbon neutral"" if they offset their emissions with payments either to avoid a reduction in emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2104,But these are two very different things.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2105,"For example, one way to avoid a reduction in emissions is to pay someone not to cut down the trees on the land they own.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2106,"This is a good thing, but in effect it pays someone not to do something that would have a negative impact.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2107,It doesn't lead to planting more trees that would have a positive impact by removing carbon.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2108,"In contrast, ""net zero"" means that a company actually removes as much carbon as it emits.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2109,"The reason the phrase is ""net zero"" and not just ""zero"" is because there are still carbon emissions, but these are equal to carbon removal.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2110,"And ""carbon negative"" means that a company is removing more carbon than it emits each year.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2111,"While we at Microsoft have worked hard to be ""carbon neutral"" since 2012, our recent work has led us to conclude that this is an area where we're far better served by humility than pride.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2112,"And we believe this is true not only for ourselves, but for every business and organization on the planet.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2113,"Like most carbon-neutral companies, Microsoft has achieved carbon neutrality primarily by investing in offsets that primarily avoid emissions instead of removing carbon that has already been emitted.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2114,That's why we're shifting our focus.,
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2115,"In short, neutral is not enough to address the world's needs.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2116,"While it is imperative that we continue to avoid emissions, and these investments remain important, we see an acute need to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere, which we believe we can help catalyze through our investments.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2117,"In addition, we've identified another shortcoming that we and many other companies need to overcome.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2118,"Historically we've focused on Microsoft's scope 1 and 2 emissions, but other than employee travel, we haven't calculated as thoroughly our scope 3 emissions.",
Grounding in science and math,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2119,That's why we're committing to becoming carbon negative for 2030 for all three scopes.,
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2120,"Based on this science and math, we're launching today an aggressive plan to reduce Microsoft's own carbon emissions.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2121,It has three broad components.,
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2122,"First, we will drive down our scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of this decade through the following steps:",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2123,"By 2025, we will shift to 100 percent supply of renewable energy, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2124,We will electrify our global campus operations vehicle fleet by 2030.,
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2125,We will pursue International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon certification and LEED Platinum certification for our Silicon Valley Campus and Puget Sound Campus Modernization projects.,
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2126,"Second, we will reduce our scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 through new steps, including the following:",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2127,"In July 2020, we will start phasing in our current internal carbon tax to cover our scope 3 emissions.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2128,"Currently this fee is $15/metric ton and covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions, plus scope 3 travel emissions.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2129,"Unlike some other companies, our internal carbon tax isn't a ""shadow fee"" that is calculated but not charged.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2130,"Our fee is paid by each division in our business based on its carbon emissions, and the funds are used to pay for sustainability improvements.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2131,"Starting in July, all our business divisions will also pay an internal carbon fee for all their scope 3 emissions.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2132,"We will start at a lower price per ton than our current fee for other emissions, but we will phase in increases over time until all our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions are charged the same rate.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2133,This will both increase incentives across the company to reduce all scope 3 emissions and fund the added work to reduce our own scope 3 emissions and invest in carbon removal activities.,
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2134,"By July of 2021, we will begin to implement new procurement processes and tools to enable and incentivize our suppliers to reduce their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.",
Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint,Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2135,We will work with our suppliers to implement consistent and accurate reporting and pursue effective steps to make progress against scientifically based targets.,
