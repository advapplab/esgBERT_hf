Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,A key part of our strategy for helping equip people with the skills to compete for well-paying and stable jobs is bolstering community colleges and making stronger connections between community college programs and employer needs.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"With open admissions policies and lower costs relative to other institutions, community colleges play an important role in creating pathways to economic mobility by providing economically and demographically diverse communities with access to career opportunities.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"As part of this, in 2021 we provided $3 million to summer youth employment programs in 20 U.S. cities to boost access to summer employment opportunities for young people",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,We are investing in career readiness efforts outside the U.S. as well.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"For example, in collaboration with the Sutton Trust, in 2021 our Firm launched a more than £4.8 million endowment fund to improve access to employment opportunities for underserved, low-income and Black and Minority Ethnic university students in the U.K., starting with 350 students in the next 10 years.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Alongside our financial support, a key focus of our employee volunteerism efforts around the world is supporting youth to prepare for future careers.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Approximately one in three working age adults in the U.S. has a criminal record, and as a result face economic barriers including hiring discrimination and lost job opportunities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,This affects individuals and their families and also has broader economic consequences that contribute to inequality.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Black adults are nearly six times more likely to be incarcerated than White adults, and Latino adults are more than three times more likely, meaning the Black and Latino communities disproportionately bear the consequences.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"JPMorgan Chase is giving people with criminal records a second chance by supporting their participation in the workforce, communities and local economies.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"We are making changes in our own hiring and recruitment practices, along with advancing a policy agenda that reduces barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"In addition, we are supporting community organizations that equip people with criminal backgrounds with the skills, resources and connections to get on a career pathway.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"For example, in 2021 we committed $12.5 million to help community organizations in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Nashville and Wilmington connect people with criminal backgrounds with in-demand, well-paying jobs and other tools to achieve their financial goals.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,We have taken a number of steps to broaden our potential talent pool and create more inclusive inroads to careers at our Firm by actively working to reduce barriers to employment for individuals with criminal backgrounds.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,We started in 2018 with the decision to “ban the box” by removing all questions about criminal backgrounds from our job applications in the U.S.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Next, we developed a program to work with community and legal aid organizations to proactively develop a pipeline of potential employees with criminal backgrounds, whose histories fit within industry guidelines, to fill open roles.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"In 2019, we piloted this Second Chance community-based hiring program in Chicago and, in 2021, we expanded the model to Columbus, Ohio, with plans to bring it to additional cities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through the program, we collaborate with local nonprofit organizations, which provide job seekers with mentorship and training to prepare them for employment opportunities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Our recruiters coordinate directly with the nonprofit to identify open roles and potential candidates, who are then connected with hiring managers within our Firm.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through these and other efforts, we hired approximately 4,000 individuals with criminal backgrounds in 2021, approximately 10% of our new hires in the U.S.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, our Firm is developing and advancing sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions to help remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Business, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, serves as a key engine of economic growth and mobility, especially in low- and moderate-income communities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"However, minority- and women-owned businesses face systemic barriers – including lack of access to capital, networks and tools – when it comes to establishing, growing and scaling their companies.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Additionally, as JPMorgan Chase Institute research has shown, the typical White-owned business has an additional week of cash liquidity compared to Black-owned businesses – critical days of buffer during stress periods like the pandemic.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through small business loans, commercial financing, mortgages and more, these institutions supply capital to fuel economic growth and, in the process, play an essential role in helping individuals in these communities build wealth.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"In order to do so, however, many MDIs and CDFIs need additional capital themselves.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through our Racial Equity Commitment, our Firm is working to strengthen minority-owned and diverse-led MDIs and CDFIs by providing additional access to capital, connections to institutional investors, policy advocacy, support for diverseled commercial projects and mentorship and training opportunities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"When we announced our Racial Equity Commitment in 2020, we pledged to invest up to $50 million over five years in the form of capital and deposits in Black, Hispanic and Latino-owned MDIs and diverse-led CDFIs.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"By the end of 2021, we had invested more than $100 million of equity in 15 diverse-owned and -led MDIs and CDFIs that serve more than 89 communities across 19 states and the District of Columbia.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"This additional capital will help these institutions hire staff, invest in technology enhancement and expand into new markets.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"According to the FDIC, every dollar of equity capital invested in MDIs can increase MDI lending by eight to ten times – meaning our Firm’s $100+ million investment could generate access to as much as $1 billion in community lending across the nation, helping to create wealth, grow local businesses and improve customers’ experiences in those communities.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"JPMorgan Chase provides holistic support for CDFIs, mobilizing different parts of the Firm to supply financing ranging from philanthropic and flexible capital to debt.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Housing, in particular, is a central pillar of community development because access to a stable, affordable home is a leading determinant of income and wealth, health and overall quality of life.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Yet for many U.S. households, especially Black, Hispanic and Latino households, an affordable housing crisis has put this access increasingly out of reach.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Through lending, equity investments and philanthropic capital; community partnerships, and data and policy insights, JPMorgan Chase is helping to build stronger communities, with a concerted focus on housing.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Financing the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing, and expanding access to homeownership, is also a core focus of our $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment (see page 21), because we know that the lack of affordable housing and rising costs of homeownership have been leading drivers of the racial wealth gap across the U.S.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"The Firm works to advance affordable housing solutions, bringing our industry expertise, a comprehensive set of financial tools and a strategy of combining our business and philanthropic efforts to create greater impact.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"As part our Racial Equity Commitment announced in October 2020, we pledged to expand on these efforts by financing the creation and preservation of 100,000 affordable rental units over five years through $14 billion in new loans, equity investments and other efforts.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"To help drive progress toward this goal, we created the Affordable Housing Preservation Program, which incentivizes landlords to keep rental units in their buildings at an affordable level.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Thanks to these and other efforts, between October 2020 and December 2021, our Firm approved funding for approximately $13 billion in loans to help preserve more than 100,000 affordable housing and rental housing units across the U.S., and increased our Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments by $400 million.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,Owning a home is critical to building wealth and ensuring financial stability over time.,
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"Yet, at the end of 2021, the homeownership gap between Black and White households was 31 percentage points – and was 26 percentage points between Hispanic and White households.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"To help address this gap, our Firm is expanding access to affordable homeownership through our home lending products and services, as well as through innovative homebuyer readiness programs and financial education services.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"As part of our Racial Equity Commitment (see page 21), we committed to originate an incremental 40,000 home purchase loans, or $8 billion in mortgages, for Black, Hispanic and Latino families over five years.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"We also committed to refinance an additional 20,000 mortgages, up to $4 billion in loans, to reduce mortgage payments for Black, Hispanic and Latino homeowners.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"To build the foundation to increase homeownership, we established a Community and Affordable Home Lending business.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"As part of this, we expanded our traditional home lending advisor network to include a new role called “Community Home Lending Advisor,” which is designed to be located in minority and low- to moderateincome communities.",

Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,"By the end of 2021, we had hired more than 150 Community Home Lending Advisors nationwide.",
Community Relations,2021-jpmorgan-ESG,We also continue to enhance our home lending products to be more accessible to customers across the full economic spectrum.,
